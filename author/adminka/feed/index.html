										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>non-fungible tokens, NFTs </strong>(Non-Fungible Token), have been around for several years, but during that time not many were interested in investing in NFTs.  However, the popularity of these did not really skyrocket until March 2021, when various famous artists, musicians, and athletes began creating and selling NFTs tied to works they had made or customized.  Grimes, Beeple and others sold creative work for millions.  NBA Top Shot tokens generated similarly high amounts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Death of the Old”, a work by Grimes, was part of an NFT release with which the artist raised more than US$6 million.  Source: https://www.instagram.com/p/CL2VYW7BXzM/?hl=en </p>
<p>Since then, <strong>the NFT ecosystem has been growing at a record pace.</strong> Creators are entering in droves and investors along with them.</p>
<p>What are NFTs actually?  How to invest in them?  And should we consider them as a good long-term investment?</p>
<h2><strong>TL;  DR: What are non-fungible tokens or NFTs?</strong></h2>
<p>Non-fungible tokens are unique blockchain-based “currencies”.  No two tokens are the same and therefore they are not interchangeable.  these tokens <strong>are usually associated with pieces of creative content</strong>.  However, they do not necessarily represent intellectual property.</p>
<p>NFTs have received their fair share of criticism.  Many in the art community are concerned about the carbon footprint of non-fungible tokens from the Ethereum 1.0 blockchain technology.  Others have pointed to the lack of fraud protection in this space.  Some experts even suggested that NFTs could fuel the problem of money laundering in the art world.</p>
<p>However, advocates of non-fungible tokens have said that<strong> technology could act as the basis for a more stable and functional creative economy. </strong>Because NFTs can be programmed to pay royalties to their creators each time they exchange hands, they can provide a regular source of income for their creators.  Also, because NFTs do not always represent intellectual property, they offer a more flexible model for sales and creative property.</p>
<p>Some have also programmed NFTs for use in various fields beyond art, music, and sports.  Real estate can be linked to non-fungible tokens. <strong>NFTs can be used to sell tickets for live events</strong>unique digital objects in video games and much more.</p>
<h2><strong>Are NFTs a good long-term investment?</strong></h2>
<p>While non-fungible tokens may be extremely popular right now, <strong>it is not known how long this popularity will last</strong>, or whether NFTs will be a good long-term investment.  Many analysts agree that the NFT market is almost purely speculative at the moment.</p>
<p><img src="https://infobloom.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1656501735_357_Guide-to-buying-and-investing-in-NFTs-safely.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Therefore, it is advisable <strong>treat NFTs as if they were any other type of investment</strong>.  Don&#8217;t invest more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p><img src="https://infobloom.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1656501736_560_Guide-to-buying-and-investing-in-NFTs-safely.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>However, in some cases, NFTs can be purchased as a way for fans to build relationships with creators they admire.  For example, 3LAU sold an NFT that included the creation of a custom song for its buyer;  Rob Gronkowski sold an NFT that offered the buyer VIP tickets to his next beach party.</p>
<p><strong>Other non-fungible tokens offer their holders the opportunity to participate in how a piece of digital art or music is presented. </strong>For example, NFTs linked to “Betty&#8217;s Notebook,” a programmable piece of music by the Verdigris Ensemble, allow its holder to manipulate certain elements of the piece.</p>
<p><img width="683" height="1024" alt="infographic how to invest ntfs non fungible tokens"  src="https://infobloom.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Guide-to-buying-and-investing-in-NFTs-safely.jpg" data- class="wp-image-29087 lazyload"/></p>
<h2><strong>How to invest in NFT: what you need to know</strong></h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve chosen a piece of digital art or music, a digital trading card, or another type of digital collectible, the next step is to purchase it.  Pretty simple, right?  yes, but <strong>Buying an NFT is not always as simple as buying a “real world” collectible.</strong></p>
<p>The methodology for purchasing a non-fungible token depends on the NFT market in which you will make your purchase.  Some NFT markets may allow investors to purchase their tokens with credit cards;  others will require you to use crypto directly.</p>
<p>In the latter case, the type of cryptocurrency you will need to make the purchase will depend on the blockchain on which the NFT was created.</p>
<p>For example, markets<strong> OpenSea.io and Nifty Gateway </strong>they only sell non-fungible tokens that have been minted on the Ethereum blockchain.  Therefore, to buy NFTs on these platforms, you will need to use an Ether token.  Similarly, other platforms may offer sales in BNB, ADA, DOT, or native tokens belonging to other smart contract-enabled networks.</p>
<h2><strong>Storage of non-fungible tokens</strong></h2>
<p>Safely storing NFTs is vital to protecting the investment in the long term.  Some NFT platforms offer their users the option to keep their tokens on the platform.  However, there have been several examples of account takeovers within the platforms.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>NFT holders should consider having a digital wallet </strong>(wallet) of safer self-custody.  Depending on the blockchain your NFTs are minted on, you will need a different type of digital wallet.  Some NFT markets have integrated with crypto wallets that have browser extensions, such as MetaMask.</p>
<p>Whenever a crypto wallet is created, make sure the password is visible to you and you alone.  You should create wallets only with trusted providers.  Make sure the site you are using to generate your digital wallet is not a phishing scam.</p>
<h2><strong>NFT stocks to invest</strong></h2>
<p>Investing directly in a non-fungible token can be risky.  If you are not comfortable with such a high level of risk, you might consider investing in stocks related to the NFT market.</p>
<p>Even with NFT shares, however, <strong>there is a variable level of risk.</strong> Each level of risk depends on the business model of the company issuing the shares.  For example, does the company offer a platform that people can use to create NFTs?  Or are they issuing NFTs themselves?  Or something else?</p>
<p>When considering whether or not to invest in an NFT stock, be sure to keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long is the company in operation?  What is the annual rate of growth of the firm&#8217;s investment earnings?</li>
<li>How volatile has the stock price been in the past?  What is the price/earnings ratio (P/E)?  What is the price/book value (P/CV) ratio?</li>
<li>What is the business model of the company?  In other words, how does the company plan to make a profit?</li>
<li>Does the company have any competitive advantage?</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is always someone, somewhere in the world, hatching plans to get tricks and scams carried out in order to make money from the less cautious. That is why we warn of possible scams whenever they reach our ears and that is why we do it again now with <strong>the return of a system that the Police itself is denouncing</strong>.</p>
<p>The authorities warn us to be careful if we find on our phone any <strong>missed call with an international prefix</strong> and that, under no circumstances, we return the call to these telephone numbers. In addition, being automated calls, the numbers can be very varied but the Police have been in charge of pointing out some of the conflicting prefixes.</p>
<h2>Numbers with premium rate</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Receiving missed calls from these numbers may cause us to unknowingly return the call in order to find out the reason for the contact. We should never do it because it is about <strong>premium rate phones that will inflate our bill</strong> keeping us on the phone with, usually, automatic locutions whose sole purpose is to prevent us from hanging up too soon.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Police speak of missed calls received from numbers in the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Albania and Bosnia, and in the comments to the authorities&#8217; tweet <strong>warn also of the prefix of Mali or Libya</strong>. Let&#8217;s see what prefixes they are so as not to return the call, not even out of curiosity, if we find &#8220;lost&#8221; from these countries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ivory Coast &#8211; Prefix 225</li>
<li>Ghana &#8211; Prefix 233</li>
<li>Nigeria &#8211; Prefix 234</li>
<li>Albania &#8211; Prefix 355</li>
<li>Bosnia &#8211; Prefix 387</li>
<li>Mali &#8211; Prefix 223</li>
<li>Libya &#8211; Prefix 218</li>
</ul>
<p>Some mobile phones have the option of <strong>block calls from the menu itself</strong>, so we can stop receiving missed calls from these numbers as soon as we receive them. If our phone does not have this possibility, in the application store (Android) we find applications for these purposes such as Black List, Call Blocker or Calls Blacklist.</p>
<h2>don&#8217;t call back</h2>
<p>Unless the number is in your phonebook because it belongs to an acquaintance or relative, of course, in that case there will be no risk. But before unknown numbers, better to keep <strong>a defined pattern of action: do not return the call and block the number</strong>. When in doubt, it is better to stay with the intrigue than to incur expenses that, whether we claim it or not, will have occurred voluntarily on our part.</p>
<p>This is our recommendation when it comes to protecting yourself against scams such as missed calls. As usual, <strong>the premise is to be careful</strong> with the numbers we dial so as not to incur additional unwanted expenses. In case new methods appear to make us fall for scams, we will try to warn you as soon as possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Art</p>
<p>The <strong>contemporary art</strong> It is an important type of art that includes more than fifty types of expressions which have emerged since the end of the <strong>Second World War</strong>. Gaining an understanding of contemporary art requires the study of many theories that have been put forth over roughly six decades of art. The common denominator is that the <strong>talent</strong> <strong>artistic</strong> must be formally recognized by the art world. Some contemporary artists reflect the influence of <strong>Modernism</strong>including the <strong>Impressionism</strong>the <strong>Surrealism</strong> and the <strong>Cubism</strong>and others separate from <strong>Postmodernism</strong>even eliminating all kinds of connection with the artistic movements that occurred in the past.</p>
<h2>what is the contemporary art?</h2>
<p>It is a concept that names the general form of artistic expressions that originated in the <strong>twentieth century</strong> or time <strong>current</strong> from the different <strong>hatchings</strong> of <strong>Vanguard</strong> that occurred at the beginning of the present century.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of contemporary art</h2>
<p>The main characteristics of contemporary art are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is based on the <strong>abstract expressionism</strong>.</li>
<li>has a legacy of <strong>vanguards</strong> artistic and look for different forms of expression.</li>
<li>It has foundations from <strong>abstract art</strong>.</li>
<li>His works are <strong>originals</strong>artistic and leave the imprint of the author who makes them.</li>
<li>media or <strong>instruments</strong> to make the works of contemporary art are changing and new technologies are used every day.</li>
<li>It is influenced by <strong>fauvism</strong>, <strong>neoplasticism</strong> and in the <strong>cubism</strong>.</li>
<li>Give emphasis to the <strong>expressions</strong> of the I and at <strong>emotions</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>colors</strong> that are used are strong and the content is symbolic.</li>
<li>seek to manifest the <strong>movement</strong> and the repetition of objects on the canvases.</li>
<li>art is kind <strong>avant-garde</strong> Y <strong>surreal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Contemporary art originated at the end of the <strong>XIX century.</strong> It was formed as a result of the dragging of <strong>techniques</strong> that came from that century, and it is considered that the <strong>impressionism</strong> and the <strong>postimpressionism</strong> were the concepts that drove its creation. It was based from its beginnings on different avant-garde movements such as the <strong>cubism</strong>, <strong>expressionism</strong>, <strong>surrealism</strong>, <strong>futurism</strong> Y <strong>Dadaism</strong>. These currents had as a common aspect the <strong>innovation</strong> and giving art a different space than it had in ancient times. Already in the 20th century, contemporary art breaks traditional patterns and imposes new characteristics on the way of making art.</p>
<h2>Importance of contemporary art</h2>
<p>Contemporary art is important because it gives us the idea that art is not separate from life or the world we live in. The practice of contemporary art has become an exchange between <strong>artist</strong> and the <strong>viewer</strong> more than an image or object that we hope to admire. Contemporary art has come to become an extension of life that seeks <strong>questions</strong>, <strong>order</strong> Y <strong>coherence</strong>. Promotes questions about our <strong>life</strong> And it also brings fun.</p>
<h2>Types</h2>
<p>The types of art that are included in contemporary art are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fauvism</strong>: emerged as a reaction to the <strong>impressionism</strong>. The main aspect of him was the <strong>color</strong>the <strong>stains</strong> flat and wide.</li>
<li><strong>Cubism</strong>: Its creators were Picasso and Braques. used <strong>neutral tones</strong> to create a fourth dimension. It had greater exaltation of the plane and they used transparencies.</li>
<li><strong>Expressionism</strong>: It emerged in Germany and was a means to express the <strong>heartaches</strong> suffered by the individual through paintings full of <strong>dramatics</strong>expressive and through the caricature of the figures.</li>
<li><strong>Dadaism</strong>: It emerged as a <strong>protest</strong> before the <strong>first World War</strong>. It was a kind of mockery before the <strong>technology</strong> and the <strong>progress</strong>. His main objective was to scandalize the <strong>bourgeoisie</strong> of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Surrealism</strong>: The painters used resources such as <strong>animation</strong> of the inanimate world, the isolation of anatomy, fantastic machines evoking chaos.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract art</strong>: Known as art <strong>kinetic</strong> either <strong>pop art</strong>, I was looking for a style that would give movement to the works. The base of it said that any kind of shape <strong>geometric</strong> that was drawn could lose the <strong>stability</strong> on the retina of the person who was observing it by means of optical illusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>It is mainly the modern architecture of our times that begins to be created in the <strong>century</strong> <strong>XX</strong>. The main idea of ​​this type of architecture is to reject the <strong>historical styles</strong> that were used in ancient times. It arises from the change that the Revolution brings <strong>Industrial</strong> and the revolution <strong>French</strong> because with them new <strong>materials</strong> of construction and <strong>costs</strong> of the products were reduced. The most important buildings were <strong>columns</strong>, <strong>temples</strong>, <strong>triumphal arches</strong> and the <strong>propylaea</strong>. Iron, zinc and glass began to be used. The <strong>engineering</strong> began to have more importance in architecture.</p>
<h2>Sculpture</h2>
<p>It is considered one of the most modern in art and was influenced by different artistic movements. The <strong>change</strong> is its main characteristic and the <strong>functions</strong> traditions that it had were lost over time. The sculptures include <strong>New Materials</strong> and new ones were used <strong>functions</strong> Y <strong>symbologies</strong>. Its tendencies are constantly <strong>evolution</strong> and the human figure with contemporary art lost importance.</p>
<h2>Paint</h2>
<p>It arises as a consequence of <strong>modern Art</strong> and its bases were a set of <strong>signs</strong> Y <strong>symbols</strong> started by modern painters. His main moves were <strong>impressionism</strong>, <strong>expressionism</strong> Y <strong>neo-impressionism</strong>. The first modern painter of whom we have reference was <strong>Francisco de Goya</strong> and the best modern painter was <strong>Vincent Van Gogh</strong> whose paintings gave rise to abstract painting and Fauvism.</p>
<h2>Representatives of contemporary art</h2>
<p>Some of the most outstanding representatives of contemporary art are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ai weiwei</li>
<li>Jeff Koons</li>
<li>yayoi kusama</li>
<li>Damian Hirst</li>
<li>Yoko Ono</li>
<li>Theaster Gates</li>
<li>And famous classical artists like Dali, Picasso, Van Gogh.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples of notable works</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>gold marilyn monroe</strong> by Andy Warhol</li>
<li><strong>Blue Poles</strong> by Jackson Pollock</li>
<li><strong>The Persistence of Memory</strong> by Salvador Dali</li>
<li><strong>the son of man</strong> by Rene Magritte</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OpenSea supports NFT trading across multiple blockchains.  This guide explains how to use our Polygon marketplace to create and sell NFTs <strong>without paying any gas fees.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right- <strong>no gas fees or ETH are needed</strong>!</p>
<h2>Creating a Collection on Polygon</h2>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"></p>
<p>Next, click <strong>&#8220;Create a collection&#8221;</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://infobloom.site/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1653858146_785_How-do-I-create-and-sell-NFTs-on-Polygon-–.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-12-03_at_6.29.22_PM.png"></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update</strong>: This entry is a joke on the occasion of April Fools&#8217; Day (December 28). Therefore its content is not true</p>
<p>The Central Banks are in a very delicate moment. On the one hand they have injected <strong>strong amounts of liquidity in the markets</strong>, which is surely one of the causes (perhaps the main one) of the incipient inflation that we are seeing. However, withdrawing the stimulus could cause the collapse of economies that are still growing weakly.</p>
<p>Given all this, the ECB has had an imaginative, innovative idea that will surely mark a before and after in the monetary policies that Central Banks have at their disposal: <strong>the issuance of NFTs</strong>.</p>
<h2>NFTs as liquidity drainers</h2>
<p>The classic way of draining the markets of liquidity has been through the sale of bonds. But if the ECB starts selling part of its incredible balance of bonds, the States would have problems financing themselves and interest rates would rise.</p>
<p>That is when the ECB came up with a genius: take advantage of the NFTs (non-fungible tokens) fever to drain the economy of liquidity. They know that fans of NFTs buy everything that is traded and at incredible prices, so the idea of ​​the ECB is to create NFTs en masse and put them up for sale, in order to raise money without the need to sell classic financial instruments.</p>
<p>At the moment there will be a small series: photos of euro banknotes, the video of <strong>Mario Draghi saying his classic &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221;</strong> or the document in which Trichett raised interest rates at the height of the crisis. But the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, has already said that this is only the beginning: &#8220;as if we have to take pictures of all the corners of our facilities, we are going to market NFTs like crazy; no matter what we put, everyone wants NFT&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<h2>a new blockchain</h2>
<p>When Lagarde was asked if these NFTs would be on Ethereum, he replied &#8220;Are we crazy? No way. <strong>Ethereum is the jurisdiction of the ECB</strong>. We will set up our own Blockchain, much better than those parodies of money. A centralized blockchain, as it should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenges of setting up a new Blockchain are great, but being centralized will surely be minor. The real challenge is that all this liquidity that the ECB is going to drain does not go to hiring engineers to program smart contracts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is a high risk investment?</h2>
<p>A high-risk investment is an opportunity to make a profit that, due to the inherent volatility of the asset, has a higher risk of losing money.  Sometimes high-risk investments have a higher potential for profit compared to more conventional investments, but this is coupled with an equally higher risk of loss.</p>
<p>However, while some investments may be considered riskier than others, it is important to remember that all trading involves risk.  Consequently, you should ensure that you are comfortable with your exposure and that you understand the risks you will face when trading the markets.</p>
<h3>What does &#8220;high risk, high return&#8221; mean?</h3>
<p>“High risk, high return” means that an opportunity has a higher degree of risk, but this comes with a higher potential return.  High risk, high return is sometimes called the risk-return tradeoff and is a theory that the potential return on an investment is greater when there is greater risk associated with it.</p>
<h2>Description of the risk-reward ratio</h2>
<p>Investors use the risk-reward ratio to compare the expected returns of a given trade with the amount of risk they will be exposed to over the duration of the trade.</p>
<p>As a result, investors can use the risk-reward ratio to determine the level of potential risk and potential losses, while also suggesting a trade&#8217;s upside potential and potential profits.</p>
<p>A risk-reward ratio greater than 1 means that the risk is greater than the expected return, and a ratio less than 1 means that the expected return is greater than the potential risk.</p>
<h2>High risk trades with leveraged products</h2>
<p>There are two ways of trading in the financial markets: buying and selling an asset, such as a share, or using leveraged financial products, such as CFDs, to speculate on the price of the underlying asset without actually buying it.  If you think it&#8217;s going to go up, you&#8217;ll go long.  Conversely, if you think the price is going to go down, you will go short.</p>
<p>More information on CFD trading</p>
<p>Your profit or loss is determined by the degree to which your assessment of the asset&#8217;s price movement is correct.  If you go short, the price of an asset will need to go down for the trade to be profitable, and if you go long, you need the price to go up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Buying or selling second-hand on the Internet is completely safe if you meet certain minimum standards. </h2>
<p>It is true that some malicious sellers or buyers look for ways to scam using second-hand buying and selling sites, but if we are alert we can avoid them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  To avoid being deceived, it is best to take into account some basic security recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be wary of ads with extraordinarily low prices and those where the price is in a currency other than your country&#8217;s.</li>
<li>Do not trust if the seller is abroad or the ad is not in Spanish or if it is in Spanish it is poorly written and uses unusual words.<br />
<blockquote><p>    Examples: </p>
<p>Adorable malted puppies for your approval: these puppies are well socialized with children and other</p>
<p>House animals.  They are cage registered, house trained and prepared for their new permanent families.  They are up to date on all vaccinations and deworming and will come along with all health documents.  The cubs are both male and female.  We will give the puppies out only to serious dog loving families.  Our children only want a perfect home where they will find a new love.</p>
<p>Teacup Yorkies for your approval: She is a pure bred teacup yorkies puppy, akc registered and also potty trained.  She is healthy and very friendly, she will drill you with lots of affection and entertainment.  Contact me for more information if you would like to make her a part of her family.</p>

Any of the phones that is not in good condition should be returned immediately to us and we will bear the return charges and replacements</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Be wary of business proposals that sound too good to be true.  Within this category are promises to fix your credit problems, business or job opportunities that guarantee big daily income, risk-free, high-interest investments, and free travel.<br />
<blockquote><p>
    Examples:</p>
<p>The opportunity of our lives: As an investor I see that x is giving the opportunity of our lives, which is going to benefit many people and I know that I am going to be one of those people.  Its multilevel service is closing its level zero, this Monday, October 13, which gives you the advantage of automatically moving to level one when you sign up with $100 dollars.  Do not miss this opportunity that we offer you.  For more information see x</p>
<p>Earn money effortlessly: The most transparent multilevel, designed for all types of investors.  Cheer up to earn a lot of money, you have little time left.  Registration closes Friday, October 10, register now.</p>
<p>What do you think about retiring in 2 years?: If what you want is to change your lifestyle, obtain a good income, retire in a few years, and have time to enjoy, with your family and friends, without having to think about the lack of of money.  Then I can help you, just leave me your data!</p>
<p>Earn $1,000 per sale: We offer you a top-quality product in the world of leisure and tourism at a price of x$, leaving a profit margin of x$ for your franchisees.  for more information&#8230;</p>
<p>Travel and earn money: it&#8217;s your chance.  Collect up to $1000 in commissions and travel the world.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Beware of job offers that ask you for something in advance or that to request the interview you call a special rate Telephone: 803, 806, 807, 905, etc.<br />
<blockquote><p>Example:<br />We facilitate work at home advertising activity by enveloping: Profitable from the beginning, copy, send texts, very simple.  You can get a bonus.  A serious company pays you for the work done, no matter where you live, it is offered throughout Spain.  No experience necessary.  You can combine it with your current job.  Interested parties send your request for information, indicating full name and address, along with two postage stamps of 0.43 cts.  to the post office box</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Be wary if the seller asks you to email your credit card information.  In no case should you send your credit card data: card number, security code, expiration date, name of the holder, etc.</li>
<li>Try to request as much information as possible from the seller: address, telephone number (if possible landline), etc.  check that there are no inconsistencies in the data.  For example, that the province in which the seller is located coincides with the prefix of the telephone number.  That the seller does not give you a phone number or tells you that he does not have it is something that should put you on alert.  Finally, search for seller information on Google by entering the email address or phone number and looking at the references that appear.  You will be able to see among other things if there is any complaint about him.</li>
<li>Before initiating any type of payment, try to speak on the phone with the seller (fraudsters do not usually get on the phone or the phone they give does not exist)</li>
<li>Never pay in advance if you are not sure of the identity of the buyer.  For more security you can use the payment on delivery with verification of the article.  Be even more suspicious if, while the seller is abroad, he asks you to make a transfer in advance using a bank that you do not know (generally they are not banks, but companies that only transfer money between countries).  Ultimately, make sure it&#8217;s not an anonymous account and ask for all the details from the account holder.</li>
<li>Work at home ads are usually not worth your time.  Be very wary of ads that promise huge annual salaries: they often demand expensive upfront costs with no guarantees.  You risk wasting money, time and energy.  (in the United States they have been using this technique for some time and they warn of the problems)</li>
<li>Find out if what you want to buy is sold by someone near where you live, so you can do the sale in person and see or try what you buy before paying for it.  In bulletin boards you can see the announcements in your neighborhood.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Common scams:</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Job offers for which to arrange an interview you have to call a premium rate number: 803, 806, 807, 905, etc.</li>
<li>Sale of luxury items: Watches, bags, etc.  if the price is very low, they are usually replicas of the originals.</li>
<li>Sale of second-hand vehicles: Once contacted, the seller explains why the price is so cheap (always related to some issue of separation, economic problems, etc.) and that the vehicle is in another country.  It is also common for the seller to be on a trip and not return to Spain soon.  In the end they will ask us for a transfer of a small amount as an excuse to pay paperwork or send the car.  If we make the transfer the vehicle will never arrive.</li>
<li>Contact ads: in which they ask you to send an sms to contact.  Once the SMS was sent, we received another one saying that they could not read it correctly and asking us to send it again.  Ace several times with different excuses.</li>
<li>Holiday home rental: usually the ad is for a villa on the coast at a relatively low price.  Once the advertiser is contacted, he tells us that he is abroad, usually in England, and asks us to make a transfer in advance for the reservation of the holiday home.  They don&#8217;t usually give the phone number and if they do, it&#8217;s wrong and they don&#8217;t usually give details of the account holder either, or they are false.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>In case you are the seller</u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>One of the most common scams that we have to be aware of when we decide to sell something second-hand online are false buyers.  Their way of acting is as follows: First they send an email showing their interest in the property advertised and asking us for our account details to pay by bank transfer;  then they notify us of the completion of the transfer and ask us to send the object immediately.  The scam is that the information they send us about having made the transfer is false and the money never reaches our account.
<p>A common feature in this type of scam is that the emails are written in English or French and they always ask for bank details.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Seller, I&#8217;m Dr John Bulluck from United Kingdom.  It&#8217;s my pleasure to realize this your advertised item fit my exact search.  Firstly let me confirm if this product (s) is available for shipment overseas as i&#8217;ll love to buy the item as Charity support to a Charity organization located outside the United State.  I&#8217;ll offer you 500.00 for this product including cost of freight to the Destination.  Also i&#8217;ll like to make payment via international bank transfer/payment from my BANK or via PayPal, so if my offer is accepted, do get back to me with your preferred payment option.  if by bank transfer, do email with your bank account.  Bank Name, Account holder&#8217;s name,Bank Country, Account Number,IBan or Swift,if by PayPal do email me your PayPal account email address.</p>
<p>Dear seller, I saw your item and will like to know if still available for sale and the present condition of this item and get back to me with the total cost alongside your payment information because the item is urgently needed&#8230;Hope to read from you soon&#8230;</p>
<p>Bonjour Mr ou Mme, je suis Mr Perrier armel homme d&#8217;affaire, Franais de nationalit, je voudrais avoir plus de details consernant votre annonce, je vous prie donc de bien vouloir me donner les details consernant la vente de votre maison et si possible quelque photos yes interresente, I never ache achet de maison et j&#8217;ai pas de notaire.  J&#8217;attends de vous lire au plus vite&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Sending bad checks: The buyer sends us a check (usually for a value greater than the agreed price), and later asks us to send him the difference.  The problem is that days after depositing the check, the Bank rejects it due to insufficient funds.  With which we not only lose the article but the amount returned to the false buyer.</li>
<li>Buying second-hand cars.  In this case, a supposed buyer, usually from Africa, sends us an email saying that he wanted to buy a second-hand car for his son who was in Italy and that his birthday was coming up, so he urged him and wanted to close the transaction as soon as possible. , even paid a little more than what was requested&#8230;</li>
</ol>
<p>And above all, choose a trusted site.  At tablondeanuncios.com we review all ads daily before publishing them.</p>
<p><strong><u>What do I do if I think I&#8217;ve been scammed?</u></strong></p>
<p>  The first thing you can do to confirm if you have been the target of a scam is to contact the customer service of the website where you had the ad.  They will be able to give you some guidance on what to do.</p>
<p>In any case, you can always choose between reporting it to the computer crimes unit of the National Police or the Civil Guard.  The Mossos dEsquadra (in Catalonia) and the Ertzaintza (in the Basque Country) also collect reports of these crimes, in the indicated Autonomous Communities.</p>
<p>This article has been written by the customer service team atTablondeanuncios.com.  All recommendations given are based on our experience and that of our users.  The cases reported and the examples given are real.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After two long years without being able to enjoy one of the most fun music and art festivals, finally, <strong>The Ceremony Festival is almost here! This festival has become one of our favorite shows for its inclusive vision and for always bringing incredible surprises. </strong>This year was not the exeption! and by 2022, <strong>Festival Ceremonia launches its first collection of NFTs</strong> And, we must tell you, they are amazing!</p>
<p><strong>But what is an NFT?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Its acronym corresponds to Non Fungible Token, and it is a unique asset that cannot be modified or exchanged for another that has the same value.</strong>since no two NFTs are equivalent. <strong>They work through blockchain technology by which they are assigned a certificate of authenticity.</strong> Yes! It is basically a virtual work of art.</p>
<p><strong>The collection is called &#8220;Ceremonios&#8221; and is based on the main cards that appear in the video poster of Ceremonia 2022. </strong>In addition, if you purchase it, you will be able to enjoy different benefits and new experiences not only at this year&#8217;s festival, but also in future editions!</p>
<p>But that is not all! Though<strong> the collection includes 2,022 unique and irreplaceable pieces</strong>which can be acquired by all attendees, <strong>400 NFTs will be awarded to all those who saved their ticket for the Ceremony 2020 </strong>as a reward to his community of fans for the expected time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If they get a <b>mail </b>which claims to be the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT), you have to be careful.  The Civil Guard has warned of a <b>new type of scam related to fake traffic tickets</b>.  Fraudsters use<b> a fraudulent email campaign</b>known as a &#8216;phishing&#8217; method, with which <b>supplant the DGT</b>. </p>
<p>This email l<b>bears the logo of the entity and the Ministry of the Interior</b>and sends a message that reads: &#8220;You have a pending fine&#8221;, and then they put a link that takes you to the alleged notification, which of course is false. </p>
<p>When the victim of the scam clicks on this link, malware is automatically downloaded onto their device.  Namely, <b>a malicious program that is capable of stealing your personal and financial data</b>.  So, in this way, fraudsters can access your usernames and passwords to access all kinds of platforms and social networks, including the bank&#8217;s website. </p>
<p>Likewise, <b>scammers often use this type of method during vacation times</b>, such as during Easter, since it is common for many people to make long journeys with their vehicles on those dates.  For this reason, one of the organizations that has denounced this action, the <b>OR IF</b>, has warned that if the &#8216;malware&#8217; has been executed or simply downloaded, the device has been automatically infected.  The <b>Internet Security Office assures </b>that, to solve this problem, it is advisable to go to the <b>downloads folder and delete the file</b>in addition to deleting the mail from the inbox. </p>
<p>In any case, once both steps are completed, the organization highlights the<b> importance of scanning the device with an antivirus to know the real status of the device</b> and demonstrate whether it is safe to use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The main axis of the event revolves around the #BUIDLATHON, which consists mainly of <strong>a hackathon where teams of developers compete for prizes and rewards (+2M US$) </strong>offered by the sponsors for the projects they build throughout the entire event.  In total, there are 30 places for the finalists among more than 1,000 projects that work to be presented in person and virtually.</p>
<p><strong>In this 2022 edition, there were marked trends in projects related to NFTs</strong> (to find new uses), <strong>DAO&#8217;s</strong> (how they will be the fundamental pillar for the decentralized world) and, finally, <strong>DeFi</strong> (a trend already developed in the ecosystem that seeks new ways to make it even more scalable).</p>
<h2><strong>Three trends that lead the way</strong></h2>
<p>The collections of NFTs had their space in a gallery format where, at the same time, they were complemented with uses that people who have one can give them, beyond their monetary value.</p>
<p><strong>From certifying the presence at an event with NFT, to the creation of DAOs</strong> to help independent artists boost their collections.</p>
<p>20220224_134252.jpg</p>
<p></p>
<p>ETHDenver 2022: projects related to NFTs, DAOs and DeFi stood out in this edition.</p>
<p>In that sense, <strong>the DAOs confirmed that they are very installed</strong> among the participants.  Many caliber projects in the crypto ecosystem base their representation on decisions made by their DAO.  It is essential to highlight the community that is generated around this, giving it decision-making power and full influence of where they want the project to go. <strong>A disruptive model that is still unknown to many people</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>several projects worked on scalability improvements for DeFi</strong>.  It was taken from different angles: for experienced traders, institutional investors, to improve existing solutions, and also for easy accessibility to those who are not using DeFi products today.</p>
<h2><strong>Cryptocurrencies to pay taxes in Colorado</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, the great news of the meeting came from the hand of the <strong>State of Colorado</strong>where the city of Denver is located, since during the conference they announced that <strong>plans to start accepting cryptocurrencies for tax payments</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, the State had already shown its favorable inclination towards blockchain technology, implementing it in the government infrastructure years ago.</p>
<p>In the words of Governor Jared Polis himself: <strong>“We are promoting Colorado as the center of the crypto economy.”</strong></p>
<p>In short, everything that happened during ETHDenver 2022 shows that the crypto future is imminent, teaching us that <strong>more and more societies decide to bet on blockchain technology</strong> to apply it in different fields (entertainment, business, economy and much more).</p>
