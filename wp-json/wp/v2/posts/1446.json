Germany\u2026 I can sum it up honestly, as a doctor, as a vaccinator, as someone who has treated people with ear, nose and throat infections all his life, I can only repeat that what is happening here has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with with a virus.<\/p>\n<p>It is about, throughout the world, the implantation of a world dictatorship, unfortunately it must be said.<\/p>\n<p>In the last month, I have spent 1,500 hours observing the situation because I knew it had nothing to do with anything medical.  I couldn&#8217;t understand what was going on, there are so many interconnected goals\u2026.  and last week in Spever, they asked me.  I spoke in front of 1,000 people -although I had never spoken in front of people before-, I never dared, I never had the courage to do it\u2026.but it has reached a point where\u2026<\/p>\n<p>It is so incomprehensible what is happening\u2026.  and everyone is dancing to the same rhythm with each other.<\/p>\n<p>And yes\u2026.and whoever it is still can&#8217;t believe it\u2026 that we have a dictatorship\u2026 there is no other way to say it.<\/p>\n<p>\u2026of course it is being disguised\u2026.of course it is happening gradually,\u2026.but that people have to\u2026.by completely disproportionate measures\u2026.literally- take to the streets to protest for the restoration of their basic rights\u2026our ancestors they wrote these exact rights into our basic laws and what they are now doing there.<\/p>\n<p>Many people won&#8217;t notice and wonder, &#8220;What&#8217;s all the fuss about?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Well, I can only say that courage, anger and a big heart\u2026 that&#8217;s what unites us, and all of this has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with a virus.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Despite being an important person with great influence in the country, few media have reported his death.
