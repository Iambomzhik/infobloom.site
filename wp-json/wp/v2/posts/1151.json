You will not come across any intimidating strings of words in the process of acquiring your NFT. The only thing you need is an Ethereum wallet and some crypto to use the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick walk through the marketplace features.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"browse\">Browse<\/h2>\n<p>NFTs can be anything, and OpenSea has done a wonderful job demonstrating that. The Browse section contains groups of NFTs, including digital art, trading cards, collectibles, virtual worlds, domains, and even tokenized physical goods. Each section features NFTs from numerous DApps and projects. You can filter by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy Now &#8211; activate NFTs you can buy straightaway;<\/li>\n<li>On Auction &#8211; NFTs you can place bids on;<\/li>\n<li>New &#8211; new listings and;<\/li>\n<li>Has Offer &#8211; those with active offers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"collections\">Collections<\/h2>\n<p>This section is embedded in the Browse section and features all NFT DApps available on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>The algorithm sorts the DApps by volumes, and at the time of writing, CryptoPunk is the most traded. Others include Rarible, Sorare, Decentraland, Hashmasks, etc.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"activity\">Activities<\/h2>\n<p>The *Activity *section shows you the listing, transfer, bids, and sales history of digital items. It tells you the who, what, where, and when about any specific NFT or collections.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"rankings\">Rankings<\/h2>\n<p>This section ranks NFT DApps in different categories such as Art, Domain Names, Virtual Worlds, Trading Cards, Sports, and Collectibles in terms of trading volumes, price, and total no. of assets. A very helpful feature for newcomers looking to acquire top-selling digital items.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"search\">Search<\/h2>\n<p>The general search function allows you to search for your preferred items, collections, and accounts.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"qualities-to-look-for-in-an-nft\">Qualities to Look For in an NFT<\/h2>\n<p>As with any digital asset, you need to run some background checks on NFTs if you plan on selling it for a higher price than you bought it. Here are some things to look out for:<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"1-liquidity\">1.Liquidity<\/h3>\n<p>While it&#8217;s okay to go for established and highly liquid NFTs like CryptoPunk, Sorare, NBA Topshot, etc., you can also go through the Activity and Ranking pages to spot relatively new and potentially \u201chot\u201d NFTs. However, they should be actively traded. Otherwise, it may be difficult to find a buyer.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"2-scarcity\">2. Scarcity<\/h3>\n<p>Some NFTs, like Sorare, group their digital cards into rare, super rare, and unique tiers. As expected, the rarer cards are more valuable and can generate hefty returns for collectors. For example, the Cristiano Ronaldo Unique sold on Sorare last month for a whopping $102.5K.<\/p>\n<p>If an NFT brand has a large and active community, it will increase your chances of finding a collector who is willing to pay more for your NFT than you did. So look out for NFTs with lively communities.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"buying-nfts-using-your-trust-wallet\">Buying NFTs Using your Trust Wallet<\/h2>\n<p>Acquiring NFTs on OpenSea has been made easier with Trust Wallet.
