Gaining an understanding of contemporary art requires the study of many theories that have been put forth over roughly six decades of art. The common denominator is that the <strong>talent<\/strong> <strong>artistic<\/strong> must be formally recognized by the art world. Some contemporary artists reflect the influence of <strong>Modernism<\/strong>including the <strong>Impressionism<\/strong>the <strong>Surrealism<\/strong> and the <strong>Cubism<\/strong>and others separate from <strong>Postmodernism<\/strong>even eliminating all kinds of connection with the artistic movements that occurred in the past.<\/p>\n<h2>what is the contemporary art?<\/h2>\n<p>It is a concept that names the general form of artistic expressions that originated in the <strong>twentieth century<\/strong> or time <strong>current<\/strong> from the different <strong>hatchings<\/strong> of <strong>Vanguard<\/strong> that occurred at the beginning of the present century.<\/p>\n<h2>Characteristics of contemporary art<\/h2>\n<p>The main characteristics of contemporary art are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is based on the <strong>abstract expressionism<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>has a legacy of <strong>vanguards<\/strong> artistic and look for different forms of expression.<\/li>\n<li>It has foundations from <strong>abstract art<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>His works are <strong>originals<\/strong>artistic and leave the imprint of the author who makes them.<\/li>\n<li>media or <strong>instruments<\/strong> to make the works of contemporary art are changing and new technologies are used every day.<\/li>\n<li>It is influenced by <strong>fauvism<\/strong>, <strong>neoplasticism<\/strong> and in the <strong>cubism<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Give emphasis to the <strong>expressions<\/strong> of the I and at <strong>emotions<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>The <strong>colors<\/strong> that are used are strong and the content is symbolic.<\/li>\n<li>seek to manifest the <strong>movement<\/strong> and the repetition of objects on the canvases.<\/li>\n<li>art is kind <strong>avant-garde<\/strong> Y <strong>surreal<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>History<\/h2>\n<p>Contemporary art originated at the end of the <strong>XIX century.<\/strong> It was formed as a result of the dragging of <strong>techniques<\/strong> that came from that century, and it is considered that the <strong>impressionism<\/strong> and the <strong>postimpressionism<\/strong> were the concepts that drove its creation. It was based from its beginnings on different avant-garde movements such as the <strong>cubism<\/strong>, <strong>expressionism<\/strong>, <strong>surrealism<\/strong>, <strong>futurism<\/strong> Y <strong>Dadaism<\/strong>. These currents had as a common aspect the <strong>innovation<\/strong> and giving art a different space than it had in ancient times. Already in the 20th century, contemporary art breaks traditional patterns and imposes new characteristics on the way of making art.<\/p>\n<h2>Importance of contemporary art<\/h2>\n<p>Contemporary art is important because it gives us the idea that art is not separate from life or the world we live in. The practice of contemporary art has become an exchange between <strong>artist<\/strong> and the <strong>viewer<\/strong> more than an image or object that we hope to admire. Contemporary art has come to become an extension of life that seeks <strong>questions<\/strong>, <strong>order<\/strong> Y <strong>coherence<\/strong>. Promotes questions about our <strong>life<\/strong> And it also brings fun.<\/p>\n<h2>Types<\/h2>\n<p>The types of art that are included in contemporary art are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fauvism<\/strong>: emerged as a reaction to the <strong>impressionism<\/strong>. The main aspect of him was the <strong>color<\/strong>the <strong>stains<\/strong> flat and wide.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cubism<\/strong>: Its creators were Picasso and Braques. used <strong>neutral tones<\/strong> to create a fourth dimension. It had greater exaltation of the plane and they used transparencies.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Expressionism<\/strong>: It emerged in Germany and was a means to express the <strong>heartaches<\/strong> suffered by the individual through paintings full of <strong>dramatics<\/strong>expressive and through the caricature of the figures.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dadaism<\/strong>: It emerged as a <strong>protest<\/strong> before the <strong>first World War<\/strong>. It was a kind of mockery before the <strong>technology<\/strong> and the <strong>progress<\/strong>. His main objective was to scandalize the <strong>bourgeoisie<\/strong> of the time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Surrealism<\/strong>: The painters used resources such as <strong>animation<\/strong> of the inanimate world, the isolation of anatomy, fantastic machines evoking chaos.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Abstract art<\/strong>: Known as art <strong>kinetic<\/strong> either <strong>pop art<\/strong>, I was looking for a style that would give movement to the works. The base of it said that any kind of shape <strong>geometric<\/strong> that was drawn could lose the <strong>stability<\/strong> on the retina of the person who was observing it by means of optical illusion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Architecture<\/h2>\n<p>It is mainly the modern architecture of our times that begins to be created in the <strong>century<\/strong> <strong>XX<\/strong>. The main idea of \u200b\u200bthis type of architecture is to reject the <strong>historical styles<\/strong> that were used in ancient times. It arises from the change that the Revolution brings <strong>Industrial<\/strong> and the revolution <strong>French<\/strong> because with them new <strong>materials<\/strong> of construction and <strong>costs<\/strong> of the products were reduced. The most important buildings were <strong>columns<\/strong>, <strong>temples<\/strong>, <strong>triumphal arches<\/strong> and the <strong>propylaea<\/strong>. Iron, zinc and glass began to be used. The <strong>engineering<\/strong> began to have more importance in architecture.<\/p>\n<h2>Sculpture<\/h2>\n<p>It is considered one of the most modern in art and was influenced by different artistic movements. The <strong>change<\/strong> is its main characteristic and the <strong>functions<\/strong> traditions that it had were lost over time. The sculptures include <strong>New Materials<\/strong> and new ones were used <strong>functions<\/strong> Y <strong>symbologies<\/strong>. Its tendencies are constantly <strong>evolution<\/strong> and the human figure with contemporary art lost importance.<\/p>\n<h2>Paint<\/h2>\n<p>It arises as a consequence of <strong>modern Art<\/strong> and its bases were a set of <strong>signs<\/strong> Y <strong>symbols<\/strong> started by modern painters. His main moves were <strong>impressionism<\/strong>, <strong>expressionism<\/strong> Y <strong>neo-impressionism<\/strong>. The first modern painter of whom we have reference was <strong>Francisco de Goya<\/strong> and the best modern painter was <strong>Vincent Van Gogh<\/strong> whose paintings gave rise to abstract painting and Fauvism.<\/p>\n<h2>Representatives of contemporary art<\/h2>\n<p>Some of the most outstanding representatives of contemporary art are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>ai weiwei<\/li>\n<li>Jeff Koons<\/li>\n<li>yayoi kusama<\/li>\n<li>Damian Hirst<\/li>\n<li>Yoko Ono<\/li>\n<li>Theaster Gates<\/li>\n<li>And famous classical artists like Dali, Picasso, Van Gogh.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Examples of notable works<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>gold marilyn monroe<\/strong> by Andy Warhol<\/li>\n<li><strong>Blue Poles<\/strong> by Jackson Pollock<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Persistence of Memory<\/strong> by Salvador Dali<\/li>\n<li><strong>the son of man<\/strong> by Rene Magritte<\/li>\n<li><strong>The fountain<\/strong> by Marcel Duchamp<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Avignon ladies<\/strong> by Pablo Picasso<\/li>\n<li><strong>The kiss<\/strong> by Gustav Klint<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Art The contemporary art It is an important type of art that includes more than fifty types of expressions which have emerged since the end of the Second World War.
