In a room that had logos of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, as well as motivational phrases in English painted on the walls, about 100 people, most of them between 15 and 30 years old, were sitting listening to a motivational comedian who makes call <strong>omar stark<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Stark introduced himself as a project leader, welcomed us and congratulated us on being &#8220;weird&#8221; enough to accept an invitation from a stranger, then began to give us information about e-commerce using as examples companies like <strong>Uber and Amazon.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>WE RECOMMEND YOU: Twitter user trolled his scammer and turned it into a melodrama<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After an hour of screams, laughter and applause from the audience, Stark said the name of the company, but not how the project works; he mentioned that to know that you have to go to <strong>another board<\/strong>whose admission costs <strong>100 pesos<\/strong>not because it&#8217;s worth it, but because &#8220;what&#8217;s free you don&#8217;t take into account&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>After paying the 100 pesos, they summoned me to the party room <strong>Le Crillon Palace<\/strong>, located in the same neighborhood; There, about 60 people, all formally dressed, came to the front and told us the story of their lives as ninis, god\u00ednez, students, there was even a man who said he was a journalist and a woman who, according to her, was a judge, <strong>everyone stopped being poor and unhappy to become rich and free with the project, or so they said.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People went on to give their testimonials one after another for three hours, until Stark took the stage and started talking about the products of <strong>bHip<\/strong>; he explained that <strong>you have to distribute and promote the merchandise on social networks, <\/strong>but we had to know them,<strong> so he gave us a taste of Blue, an &#8220;energy powder&#8221; <\/strong>that dissolves in water and tastes horrible<\/p>\n<p><strong>So how does the scam work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To be a &#8220;professional dealer&#8221; and make a profit, you must pay <strong>a kit that costs 30 thousand pesos<\/strong>, includes 30 boxes of products and a website for promotions through social networks. Believe it or not, the next day of the meeting, four people had already paid.<\/p>\n<p>They explained to me that I should <strong>create fake facebook profiles<\/strong> to send at least a thousand friend requests and daily messages to strangers; as well as calling everyone I know, to promote the products; &#8220;If you work hard you can recover your investment in up to three hours,&#8221; they told me.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is not the only way to generate income, this is where the pyramid scheme comes in, because with the same <strong>fake profiles you have to contact people, with a script that they give you<\/strong>, to invite them to join the project; for each person who decides to invest, you will earn a percentage; In addition, 10 percent of what your referrals sell, that is, a<strong> pyramid scheme.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On its website, the <strong>National Commission for the Protection and Defense of Users of Financial Services (Condusef) <\/strong>explains that in pyramid schemes, &#8220;whoever is at the top of the pyramid invites two people who, in turn, recruit two others, and so on.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the end, whoever gets more people to invest wins more money; then I discovered that there is no freedom, because even when you are already a &#8220;professional&#8221;, you must continue going to the talks, tell your testimony and to sell you have to be in the offices.<\/p>\n<p>After four days, I decided not to return anymore while listening to the same testimony; When I left I saw that there were another 100 people waiting to enter to discover how to earn money using social networks; I walked to the subway with my anger on my back, for the lost time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Do you think you can earn money online?
