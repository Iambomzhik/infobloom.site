Sometimes high-risk investments have a higher potential for profit compared to more conventional investments, but this is coupled with an equally higher risk of loss.<\/p>\n<p>However, while some investments may be considered riskier than others, it is important to remember that all trading involves risk.  Consequently, you should ensure that you are comfortable with your exposure and that you understand the risks you will face when trading the markets.<\/p>\n<h3>What does &#8220;high risk, high return&#8221; mean?<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cHigh risk, high return\u201d means that an opportunity has a higher degree of risk, but this comes with a higher potential return.  High risk, high return is sometimes called the risk-return tradeoff and is a theory that the potential return on an investment is greater when there is greater risk associated with it.<\/p>\n<h2>Description of the risk-reward ratio<\/h2>\n<p>Investors use the risk-reward ratio to compare the expected returns of a given trade with the amount of risk they will be exposed to over the duration of the trade.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, investors can use the risk-reward ratio to determine the level of potential risk and potential losses, while also suggesting a trade&#8217;s upside potential and potential profits.<\/p>\n<p>A risk-reward ratio greater than 1 means that the risk is greater than the expected return, and a ratio less than 1 means that the expected return is greater than the potential risk.<\/p>\n<h2>High risk trades with leveraged products<\/h2>\n<p>There are two ways of trading in the financial markets: buying and selling an asset, such as a share, or using leveraged financial products, such as CFDs, to speculate on the price of the underlying asset without actually buying it.  If you think it&#8217;s going to go up, you&#8217;ll go long.  Conversely, if you think the price is going to go down, you will go short.<\/p>\n<p>More information on CFD trading<\/p>\n<p>Your profit or loss is determined by the degree to which your assessment of the asset&#8217;s price movement is correct.  If you go short, the price of an asset will need to go down for the trade to be profitable, and if you go long, you need the price to go up.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is a high risk investment?
