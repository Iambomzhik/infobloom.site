Something that at first seemed like snobbery on the part of some, is now being considered as a new form of investment that can generate enormous economic benefits. It is difficult nowadays, therefore, not to understand and manage this concept in the professional economic and legal world.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs are simply defined as a category of cryptographic token, encoded on a blockchain, that represents something unique and is therefore irreplaceable. These qualities have made NFTs a very attractive destination for art collectors, which has led to millions of dollars being paid for unique virtual works. But that is not the only fate of NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>We highlight 5 types of this model\/use of token, in a brief approximation:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The development of NFTs has allowed crypto art to emerge, as well as reviving the market for digital collectibles both as a piece of art and as a series. It could be said that these two use cases are currently the most developed since, due to their own characteristics, NFTs are the ideal model for this sector: eradicate counterfeits and revalue due to the uniqueness of the token (unique virtual work or digital collectibles).<\/li>\n<li>The explosion of NFTs in the world of music has come in two ways: on the one hand, the digitized sale of tracks (as if it were an exclusive vinyl from the analog era) or digital merchandising, and on the other, the opening to the democratization of the financing of musical campaigns. Coupled with NFTs and decentralization through blockchain technology, the crowdsourced funding model can drive a sea change in the way music is created and funded, without intermediaries in promotion.<\/li>\n<li>NFTs such as &#8220;proof of ownership&#8221; or ownership certificates. NFT proves that you own something, and that something can be anything in the world, real or digital. This feature makes NFTs an ideal instrument for the traceability and logistics of something that is also exclusive and unique. Consequently, this feature allows to authenticate, for example, tickets to sporting events or very exclusive events.<\/li>\n<li>The increasingly wide possibilities (?) of triumph of NFTs in the field of video games, since the accessories that players can acquire proliferate, having generated an ecosystem of micro transactions that amounts to billions of dollars in the present. However, this traditional gaming world so deeply rooted in society currently seems to resist the incorporation of cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology and NFTs in the prevailing ecosystem, in which fun prevails and not speculation. for now<\/li>\n<li>Utility NFTs, understood as a subcategory within NFTs that are characterized by the fact that they are used continuously, since they are acquired to provide a utility beyond being stored or collected. The utilities are multiple, from attending a digital concert of a famous singer and interacting with the community of fans, to voting on important decisions of a brand.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This token universe has logically been related or linked to the metaverse (&#8220;that intended&#8221;) immediately. Metaverses as parallel virtual worlds already exist for some, although strictly speaking the metaverse is not a video game, it is much more. Now, it is known as a metaverse for example Decentraland, a decentralized 3D virtual reality Ethereum platform consisting of 90,601 parcels of land, the virtual goods used being NFTs that can be purchased with the MANA cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p>In short, NFT is a package of information or data stored in the blockchain and Decentraland with its LAND token allows its users to access digital plots of land or parcels. And not only that, but it also allows them to conduct business within the metaverse, ranging from the construction of buildings and rental of their digital properties to the organization of parties and events.<\/p>\n<p>And increasingly, we hear that companies and services are present in this metaverse idea with their NFTs, from the British auction house Sotheby&#8217;s to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados that signed an agreement on Sunday with Decentraland (CoinDesk) for the establishment of a digital embassy that would lead it to become the first country in the world to recognize the digital sovereign land.<\/p>\n<p>In view of this growing increase in the NFTs market, considerations of all kinds arise, ranging from those who fear a possible speculative bubble (Julian Pipolo, NFTs And The Law: What Do I Really Own?) and the consequent economic losses, to those who consider most NFTs to be worthless ( Matthieu Nadini, Laura Alessandretti, Flavio Di Giacinto, Mauro Martino, Luca Maria Aiello, Andrea Baronchelli, Mapping the NFT revolution: market trends, trade networks and visual features) after analyzing data on 6.1 million transactions of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021, obtained mainly from the Ethereum and WAX blockchains.<\/p>\n<p>And as for its regulation, the South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) has just announced that it will not regulate NFTs because they are not considered digital assets, basing its decision on the fact that they are not interchangeable and, therefore, , they are used more as collectibles and not as payment methods. The immediate reaction to the decision has not been long in coming, raising fears of more than likely money laundering through NFTs, and this in a country where taxation of crypto assets begins in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>But the market for NFTs is on the rise, and the underlying legal issues are growing with it. And it is that it seems that investors are beginning to emerge who are attracted by the alleged digital properties -in the same or greater way than by real properties- accredited by means of that certificate of ownership and authenticity. And we will have to start defining its regulatory framework. A good review of the legal problems they raise has already been done by some (John Salmon, Non-fungible tokens: NFTs and the silence of the EU legislator) in the face of the current passivity\/parsimony of the EU.<\/p>\n<p>To begin with, it would be necessary to determine the legal nature of the NFTs, because, to begin with, it would be necessary to define who has the property over &#8220;what is legally&#8221; an NFT.<\/p>\n<p id=\"block-86404a11-29cb-4fb7-a149-fed9fcce3e96\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you still do not know the concept of Non Fungible Token (NFT) you are out of the world.
