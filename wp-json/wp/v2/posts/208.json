I never intended to keep the project going, and I have no plan for anything in the future,\u201d she reads. The mod was also sent some Ethereum for its troubles, and Nguyen recommended that it delete its Discord account to avoid the heat of the project&#8217;s angry investors.<\/p>\n<p>Prosecutors say Nguyen and Llacuna transferred about $1.1 million in cryptocurrency they got from the hoax to various wallets in multiple transactions designed to hide the origin of the funds.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Luckily, they were caught and now the full weight of the law will fall on them<\/h3>\n<p>That&#8217;s where the story usually ends, but it seems the pair were emboldened by their success. They prepared a series of NFTs called <strong>embers<\/strong> which was supposed to be released in March. There was even a roadmap promising that $50,000 would be donated to the Red Cross, which the charity says it did receive, with 25% of the funds collected going into a community-controlled wallet. Investigators say this would have been another &#8220;rug-pulling&#8221; scheme and he could have made an extra $1.5 million.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-233556\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651678396_366_Two-men-could-go-to-jail-for-20-years-for.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" data-lazyloaded=\"1\" data-=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Verge commented that researchers were able to match data from Nguyen and Llacuna&#8217;s Discord accounts, including the former&#8217;s IP address and the latter&#8217;s email address and phone number, with the corresponding accounts on Coinbase. These cryptocurrency exchange accounts were linked to a Citibank credit card and a government ID that allowed authorities to track them down, and both men now face charges of up to 20 years in prison.<\/p>\n<p>So hey, there was a happy ending after all. The most ironic thing is that if they are found guilty, they may end up \u201cminting\u201d car licenses in some state prison. That would be poetic justice. Still, always keep in mind with these things related to NFTs, that there is a 90% chance that the \u201cproject\u201d they are trying to sell you is a scam. Be careful.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">And you, what do you think of NFTs?
