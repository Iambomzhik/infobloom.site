Direct message scam<\/h2>\n<p>This form of scam is one of the most common in NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>As a general rule, the official project website is duplicated almost identically, making it almost indistinguishable from the original.<\/p>\n<p>Scammers often send direct messages to everyone interested in the project, via Discord or Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>In the messages they usually send links that redirect to these fake landing pages so that you can buy the project.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, even at a lower price, so that the victims feel even more the need to buy it immediately.<\/p>\n<p>Be very careful with this scam because it is really frequent.<\/p>\n<h3>Solution<\/h3>\n<p>Disable direct messages from both Discord and Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>The members of the NFT projects will never send you a direct message, they will only use the official channels.<\/p>\n<p>Do not click on any link that is not official and especially look at the URL, since in the falsified ones they usually change some letters.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, be very careful, there are cases where scammers hack the official Discords and Twitters of the projects.<\/p>\n<p>So even the official links change them for a scam link, always verify correctly before buying.<\/p>\n<p>A Discord where the different chats are disabled to talk can be synonymous with it.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Phishing scam<\/h2>\n<p>Phishing is a set of deception techniques used by hackers.<\/p>\n<p>It is quite frequent, and they impersonate the identity of the NFT project, pretending that they are the official ones in order to obtain the private data of the victims.<\/p>\n<p>This type of scam is closely related to the direct message scam.<\/p>\n<p>There are times where they pose as customer service or help support.<\/p>\n<p>They chat with you on Twitter or also through email.<\/p>\n<p>Never under any circumstances reveal the 12-digit secret key of your wallet to anyone, the real support staff will never ask you for it.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide it to them, they will empty your wallet in a matter of seconds, not only the cryptocurrencies, they will also remove all your NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>Conversation with fake Metamask support account trying to get the secret key of my wallet.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Pump &#038; Dump NFT Scam<\/h2>\n<p>This NFT scam is very simple, and has been going on in the crypto universe since practically the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>NFT scammers are in charge of increasing the price of NFT (Pump).<\/p>\n<p>They are helped by a buying group that artificially increases demand.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, also from influencers and sells well-known smokes that speak of the &#8220;next hidden gem&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>When the value of the NFT is at its maximum price, it attracts hundreds or thousands of new naive users who believe they can make millions with this new investment.<\/p>\n<p>At this moment, the fraudsters sell to obtain their profit and later the price of the asset begins to fall, since the demand at all times has been unreal (Dump).<\/p>\n<h3>Solution<\/h3>\n<p>Before purchasing an NFT collection, you should do a proper research of the project with your due diligence, and not put your money into something you don&#8217;t know about.<\/p>\n<p>Some basic considerations are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who is the team behind?<\/strong> They have already created more projects or are unknown people.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Is there good interaction from the community?<\/strong> Perhaps followers are bought.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Is there any extra utility with this particular NFT collection?<\/strong> Perhaps there is no plan for the future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Carrying out a good investigation in social networks, as well as an analysis in Opensea is almost mandatory.<\/p>\n<p>Etherscan also allows you to view all Ethereum transactions for the project&#8217;s contract wallet.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Plagiarized project<\/h2>\n<p>It is very common to see plagiarism of famous projects.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most frequent cases is that of <strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club<\/strong>in which the scammers have replicated it ad nauseam.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled, the original has a lot of value, but the fake one is worth absolutely nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can download the image and upload it to Opensea to sell it at a lower price.<\/p>\n<p>Under no circumstances should you buy these NFTs.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651591100_870_5-NFT-Scams-to-Avoid.jpg\" alt=\"Original vs. Fake NFT\" class=\"wp-image-2906\"  \/>Original vs. Fake NFT<\/p>\n<h3>Solution<\/h3>\n<p>Always correctly review the NFT collection name and transaction history on Opensea.<\/p>\n<p>The blue tick that appears next to the name of the collection means that it is verified within the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that anyone can mint an NFT and sell it on Opensea, however they are worthless.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Pull the rug (Rug pull scam)<\/h2>\n<p>The term rug pull is used in the jargon of cryptocurrencies when developers do not fulfill the promises they have kept.<\/p>\n<p>As a general rule, all projects have a roadmap of the steps after the launch and disclosure of the NFT.<\/p>\n<p>You might think that the worst rug pulling scam is when team members shut down all their networks and abscond to an island paradise with investors&#8217; money.<\/p>\n<p>However, this is not the most common situation.<\/p>\n<p>However, by performing a lighter rug pull, they make the scam last much longer, making it much more fruitful for scammers.<\/p>\n<h3>Solution<\/h3>\n<p>Carry out a good preliminary analysis of the project as a whole and check if future plans are really viable or are just smoke.<\/p>\n<p>Many projects fill roadmaps with impossible promises.<\/p>\n<p>A completely anonymous and non-transparent team of developers is already a good reason to be suspicious.<\/p>\n<h2>conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>This might seem pretty strict, but question everything and assume it&#8217;s all a scam until you can verify the source.<\/p>\n<p>Being always vigilant will lead you to avoid many scams in the world of NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>A good precaution would be to use different crypto wallets, whether you use Metamask, Coinbase\u2026etc<\/p>\n<p>You can use one to store NFTs and the other for purchases you make.<\/p>\n<p>Also, avoid having accumulated a high amount of cryptocurrencies that you are not going to use.<\/p>\n<p>Still, you always have to learn from mistakes, act responsibly and know that you are investing in something very risky.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just as NFTs have proven to be a millionaire opportunity, they are also an opportunity to carry out millionaire scams.
