The user can hide his phone number and thus prevent other people from writing it down.<\/p>\n<p>That is the main attraction of Telegram, anonymity.<strong> User can join channels, chats and Bots<\/strong> (robots) without the administrators being able to know personal data, which is why it has become an excellent option to generate income without leaving a trace.<\/p>\n<p>Millions of users around the world have TG on their mobile device or desktop computer as it also <strong>It has its web version<\/strong>.  If you dedicate yourself to telecommuting and it is more comfortable for you to use Telegram web, you can also earn money.<\/p>\n<p>Now, what ways are there to earn income with Telegram?  Is this app free?  How much money can I earn?  We are going to solve all these doubts, keep reading.<\/p>\n<p>\u261d\ufe0f <strong>Click on the image to earn money on Telegram<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"toc_title\">\ud83d\udccb What you will find&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>\ud83d\udc7e Games on Telegram<\/h2>\n<p>Indeed, you can already find games that work through Telegram and that are also paying.  It is the case of this one and this one.  Both have an official application but if you prefer you can access it from their Telegram channel and play from there. <\/p>\n<p>Some pay in real money via Paypal and others however pay in tokens or cryptocurrencies.  The important thing is that it is free money that we can get for having a fun time.  In this list you can see other games that pay although they are not used by Telegram.<\/p>\n<h2>\ud83d\udcb3 Paid Subscriptions<\/h2>\n<p>An alternative to monetize Telegram is<strong> charge for people to subscribe to your channel.<\/strong> You can only afford this if you have very valuable information to offer or if it is very difficult to find such information elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that people who are willing to take out their card to enter your Channel want exclusive, educational and quality content.  If they have a bad experience they will take it upon themselves to write negative reviews, which will not benefit you in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>To have a payment channel you will have to go to external servers.  We do not know any because we think that valuable information can be in the form of a &#8220;digital course&#8221; or &#8220;PDF&#8221; but not in a Telegram channel.<\/p>\n<h2>\ud83c\udf81 Donations<\/h2>\n<p>This option is undoubtedly better than the previous one because you will only receive money from those <strong>people who want to do it of their own free will. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the description of your channel you can insert a &#8220;Donation&#8221; link that redirects to a payment platform such as Paypal, although our favorite option is cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>Do not feel bad about putting a donation link, because if you have quality content, the reader himself may feel like rewarding you for that information.<\/p>\n<h2>\ud83d\udce1 Create your own Telegram channel<\/h2>\n<p>Another way to monetize Telegram is to create your own channel for any topic, this already depends on your own interests.  If you have a local or online business or you deal with certain topics, you can create a chat that you update frequently so that all subscribers read you.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"445\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653821416_87_6-Effective-Ways-to-Earn-Money-on-Telegram\u30102022\u3011.png\" alt=\"monetize telegram with bots\" class=\"wp-image-12331\"\/><\/p>\n<p>To create a Telegram Channel you have to have the app downloaded on your phone.  Enter your account and open the Main Menu:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look for the \u201cCreate Channel\u201d option.<\/li>\n<li>write a good description<\/li>\n<li>Add the link of your website or Social Networks<\/li>\n<li>Choose if you want the \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d channel<\/li>\n<li>Add a user image<\/li>\n<li>Confirm the creation of the channel.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This can especially benefit you if you have a website, accounts on Social Networks or a Business.  Every time you make a publication, the users of the channel will have a WhatsApp-style notification and they will be able to enter to read it.<\/p>\n<p>The most remarkable thing about having a Channel is that no one can talk, there is no sender-receiver interaction, so it is not advisable to create more than one publication a day, you could make people leave.<\/p>\n<p>The themes of a Telegram channel are very varied, from bargains, travel, discounts, sports and health to business, animals, makeup or entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<h2>\ud83d\udcb0 Use affiliate programs<\/h2>\n<p>Leveraging your Telegram Channel to insert affiliate links.  Surely you have already read about it, affiliate links have a unique code inserted that \u201crecords\u201d purchases made from other devices.  So when someone else buys, you make money.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"178\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/6-Effective-Ways-to-Earn-Money-on-Telegram\u30102022\u3011.jpg\" alt=\"how to search for a product on amazon spain\" class=\"wp-image-10103\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>The best known is Amazon Affiliates, anyone can sign up for their program without having a web space.  It&#8217;s as simple as opening an account, searching for any Amazon product and<strong> generate an affiliate link<\/strong>.  Then you will be in charge of publishing it on your Telegram Channel or wherever it occurs to you and wait to receive commissions.<\/p>\n<p>But not only does AA exist, there are a variety of affiliation platforms depending on the theme, including some specialized in sensitive issues for people over 18 years of age.<\/p>\n<h2>\ud83d\udcb8 Sell by Telegram<\/h2>\n<p>Surely you already know some channels like &#8220;Me pica el chollo&#8221; or &#8220;Choll\u00f3metro&#8221; which show real bargains when buying.  Well, while you&#8217;re thinking &#8220;what an offer I just found&#8221; they <strong>they are making numbers with all the purchases that they are going to register<\/strong> with your affiliate links.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good way to sell without looking like you&#8217;re doing it.  There is a phrase that says &#8220;we like to buy but not to be sold&#8221; and it refers precisely to this.<\/p>\n<p>You can sell anything on Telegram and earn money from it.  The most advisable thing is to look for a market niche that is not very exploited and <strong>use your channel to take action.<\/strong> An example could be \u00abClothes for less than 5 euros\u00bb or \u00abVery cheap cell phones\u00bb although as you can imagine there will already be a lot that talk about the same thing.<\/p>\n<h2>\ud83e\udd16 Best bots to earn money on Telegram<\/h2>\n<p>It is the most used option by all those who seek to earn money on Telegram.  Bots are automatic chats, also known as robots, that work automatically through commands (letters and characters) and that <strong>allow us to earn real money<\/strong>either in the form of cash or digital currencies.<\/p>\n<p>The best known are the cryptocurrency bots, I dare to say that there are hundreds of them but not all of them pay, they are SCAM and they waste our time.  Don&#8217;t worry, we will only talk about those<strong> they have been paying for months<\/strong> and they have little chance of disappearing.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How can we make money with bots?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The exact question would be what exactly do we have to do to generate income with Telegram bots?  Click on any of the following Bots and open Telegram \ud83d\udc47<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"single\" style=\"font-size:40px\">\ud83d\udcb8<strong>Zelf<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\" style=\"line-height:1.5\"><strong>The first bank that works on Telegram \u2728<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul class=\"has-normal-font-size\">\n<li>Allowed for adults and minors<\/li>\n<li>Receive \u20ac20 to spend<\/li>\n<li>Without app or web, easy and simple<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">As there was a very ugly space left, I take advantage and leave you my Telegram Channel where you will find several ways to earn money \ud83d\udcb8<\/p>\n<p>Once inside the Chat you will see a Menu like this in any of the bots. <strong>There are three ways to earn money;<\/strong> for visiting other websites, for joining other chats (message bots) and for joining channels.  You just have to follow the instructions to receive your commission.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"263\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653821417_717_6-Effective-Ways-to-Earn-Money-on-Telegram\u30102022\u3011.png\" alt=\"ltc click bot telegram how it works\" class=\"wp-image-12296\"\/><\/p>\n<p>The easiest way to earn money with Telegram robots is <strong>clicking on VISIT SITES<\/strong> and see all the advertising.  You can spend hours and hours watching ads that never end since thousands of users are promoted and many others earn money for it.<\/p>\n<p>When you get tired of a Bot you can go to the next and so on until you get bored.  I have placed <strong>LTC Click<\/strong> first on the list because<strong> it is the easiest to collect,<\/strong> on the first day you can accumulate 0.0004 LTC or what is the same $0.02 dollars and request a payment.<\/p>\n<p>The way to get paid with the Telegram Bots is through an external wallet that supports cryptocurrencies, in this case, Bitcoin BTC, Litecoin LTC, Bitcoin Cash BCH, Zcash ZEC and Dogecoin DOGE.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Telegram has become another tool to earn money online.
