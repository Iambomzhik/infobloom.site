Obviously, everything pointed to being a fraud, because he did not know how this was possible.  I answered out of curiosity and the first time a woman answered, but the audio or the signal was very low, so it was cut off a lot.  In addition, it sounded as if the lady was on the street or in a crowded place, there was a lot of noise, but it did not sound like a Call Center normally does.  I hung up.<\/p>\n<p>A few hours later the same thing happened again, they called my cell phone and the call came from my own phone number.  I answered to see if I got any response.  This time a guy who knew my name answered and said he was from a bank I&#8217;ve never had a relationship with.<\/p>\n<p>The reason for the call, said the man on the other end of the line, was to offer me a card <strong>Invex Volaris<\/strong>, with discounts on flights and other things that they usually say to get you hooked.  I told him I wasn&#8217;t interested and asked him why he was dialing my same number, but there was no answer and he hung up.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2>Why did they call me from my same number?  This says the police<\/h2>\n<p>After this crazy situation, I went to Google to look for an answer and the first thing I found was a video of the former Federal Police and its cyber security area, in which they say that &#8216;you should not be scared&#8217; and point out the following:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a result of our investigations, it has been identified that it is linked to the commercial activity used by some telemarketing systems to offer products and services.  The objective of this technique is to motivate the user&#8217;s curiosity to answer the call.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"\u00bfRecibes llamadas provenientes de tu propio n\u00famero telef\u00f3nico?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/RofJ53IcGvk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Ok, if the Federal Police says it&#8217;s something normal, the &#8216;scare&#8217; gets over you, you take it as an anecdote, tell it a couple of times and forget it.  But the video does not end there, the agents indicate that they have no reports of scams or theft, in addition to the fact that there is no way to steal your data through these calls.<\/p>\n<p>They add that they work with the companies to help mitigate these &#8220;nuisance&#8221; calls and simply recommend that Mexicans not answer the phone when they are called from the same number.<\/p>\n<p>So, the Federal Government cyber police did not know about this technique and they had to do research to deduce that?  No other institution knew about it?  And how does this practice work?  How can companies trick telephone operators into making calls from a person&#8217;s number?  Is this legit?  And if someone in need of support falls for one of these calls that does turn out to be a fraud and all their data is stolen, then will they take it as a crime?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34338\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653429505_720_They-called-me-from-my-same-number-to-offer-me.jpg\" alt=\"I was dialed from my same number fraud invex card fraud volaris 4\" width=\"768\" height=\"512\"   data-pagespeed-url-hash=\"2537757134\" onload=\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);\"\/><\/p>\n<h2>Invex Volaris card calls<\/h2>\n<p>Although the now defunct Federal Police says that &#8216;you shouldn&#8217;t be scared&#8217;, the answer didn&#8217;t convince me and I looked for the product they offered when they called me from my same number: the card <strong>Invex Volaris<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that the bank<strong> Invex<\/strong> yes it exists.

But in that same year, several users asked, via Twitter, <strong>Volaris<\/strong> about whether the card offer was real.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-34339\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653429505_339_They-called-me-from-my-same-number-to-offer-me.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"928\" height=\"804\"   data-pagespeed-url-hash=\"2832257055\" onload=\"pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Volaris<\/strong> answered yes, the <strong>Invex card<\/strong> It already existed at that time, but it is by no means offered in that form.
