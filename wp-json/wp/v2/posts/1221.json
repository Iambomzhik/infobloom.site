Although it is true that the investment markets are increasingly regulated, there are still <strong>many scammers who take advantage of new technologies to falsify data and create non-existent brokers<\/strong> with the aim of stealing from traders.<\/p>\n<p>If when reading the following criteria you feel identified, analyze your situation and file a complaint.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"como-averiguar-si-soy-victima-broker-scam\" style=\"margin-top: 45px;\">How to find out if I am being a victim of a broker scam<\/h2>\n<p>If you are experiencing any of the criteria (even just one) that you are about to read below, be suspicious and check registrations, licenses, etc. from your broker.<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 25px;\">\n<li>you receive <strong>invite incentives<\/strong> to other people or gifts to deposit, etc.<\/li>\n<li>The broker promises you <strong>big benefits<\/strong>sometimes even when all markets are losing.<\/li>\n<li>The broker asks you <strong>personal documents<\/strong> that you should never provide, such as a photo or a scan of your credit card on both sides.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your advisor or account manager has a Latin accent<\/strong>: This does not mean that if your advisor is Latino, the broker is automatically a scam. What is certain is that most of the call centers of these scam brokers are located in Latin American countries.<\/li>\n<li>Your broker helps you create an investment strategy with which <strong>you earn capital at the beginning<\/strong> (this is the hook).<\/li>\n<li><strong>you suffer harassment<\/strong> constant through calls and emails.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Your advisor opens and closes trades for you<\/strong>: in retail account trading you are the one who has to invest, no reliable broker can touch the accounts of their clients, much less operate on their behalf.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You start losing and your broker insists that you deposit more money<\/strong> to avoid losing the investment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You can&#8217;t withdraw the money<\/strong>. The broker makes excuses of any kind (technical, legal, administrative&#8230;) to avoid paying the account balance.<\/li>\n<li><strong>To withdraw your deposit you have to pay more money<\/strong>, whether in the form of commissions, invented taxes (usually a UK tax), because you have a loan with the broker (as if it were a bank), etc. This is the most common strategy used by scammers to steal more money from you before they disappear.<\/li>\n<li><strong>You want to close your account and insist on offering you bonus<\/strong>or a bonus of money (they put a part as a gift if you invest more).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Communication with your broker is poor as soon as you decide to withdraw the money<\/strong>: does not respond to your messages and\/or calls, emails, etc. Normally, they take between 2 and 3 days to respond.<\/li>\n<li>It may happen that, if you are already aware of having suffered a scam, &#8220;lawyers&#8221; and\/or &#8220;agencies&#8221; contact you with the promise of getting your money back.
