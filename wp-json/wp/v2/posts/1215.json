This new way of authenticating works allows artists to be sure that their works will not be victims of plagiarism.<\/p>\n<p><b>e-Games and NFTs<\/b><\/p>\n<p>NFTs have not only taken over traditional art, dimensioning it digitally, but also the branch of entertainment has submerged as far as NFTs are concerned, such is the case of the video game called CryptoKitties.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>The users of this type of e-Games after executing the activities inherent to the game and the care of the pets in this case of CATS, can finally generate an NFT where the pet is exposed as a digital work of art to the point of being auctioned. according to market conditions and where its value can vary significantly.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that this is not the only online game that allows the accumulation of non-fungible tokens, there are many that have even allowed players to generate large sums of money, thus forming a new way of generating profits by playing.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the applications that allow the collection of tokens are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Decentraland<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">crypto seals<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">my crypto heroes <\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">gods unchained<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Binance Collectibles<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This just to mention some of the most used, does not mean that they are the only ones, there are also a variety of projects such as the case of Crypto Punk in which he created an NFT called: Ape with a Fedora hat and reached a millionaire sum in the transaction selling.<\/p>\n<p><b>Some Benefits of NFTs<\/b><\/p>\n<p>NFTs, being collectible, allow investments to be protected in a certain way, remember that non-fungible tokens are usually a form of cryptocurrencies only based on digital art. <\/p>\n<p>This is because it works under the blockchain platform and that is where its importance and security lies, in addition to the fact that obtaining or creating an NFT grants whoever owns it the property and rights over said work, this being the most important benefit.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, we find that for some time now there are many assets that can be tokenized not only in the virtual reality of games but also many types of real assets, in order to revalue them and not be victims of sudden inflation. that appears in the world.<\/p>\n<p><b>conclusion<\/b><\/p>\n<p>All these incentives that promote non-fungible tokens, somehow protecting real and digital assets from the impact of the traditional economy, helping to generate income for many through the sale of their digital works or the accumulation of capital through e-Games, is simply a tempting proposition for many and risky for others.<\/p>\n<p>It is a matter of evaluating all the scenarios and opening the possibilities of financial growth where the fundamental priority is to advance in the tokenization process to cover more and more spaces.<\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Although barely two months have passed in the year 2022, there is no doubt that the digital wallet continue to cause a stir in terms of its use and promotion.
