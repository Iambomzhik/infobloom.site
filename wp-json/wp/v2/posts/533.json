It is very likely that it is a site that just wants your money!<\/p>\n<h3>1.- Unsafe sites.<\/h3>\n<p>If from the beginning Google tells you that the site could be a scam, you have to be careful, Google can also be wrong and the site may not be fraudulent, however this is a reason why you should distrust the site a little more, especially if you are going to enter bank account data or pay money for a service.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>You can also identify if it is a secure site through the browser, Currently all formal sales sites are already secure sites and although in reality a site does not need to be secure to operate at least with it you will know the seriousness and formality from the site:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-295\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652817882_390_Are-guides-that-sell-for-ceneval-a-fraud.png\" alt=\"site_fraud\" width=\"524\" height=\"165\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-295\" data-attachment-id=\"295\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/exaniii.com\/guias-que-venden-para-ceneval-fraude\/sitio_fraude\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/exaniii.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/sitio_fraude.png?fit=524%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"524,165\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"sitio_fraude\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Sitio no seguro&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/exaniii.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/sitio_fraude.png?fit=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/exaniii.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/sitio_fraude.png?fit=524%2C165&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-295\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">not secure site<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-296\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652817882_138_Are-guides-that-sell-for-ceneval-a-fraud.png\" alt=\"safe place\" width=\"516\" height=\"157\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-296\" data-attachment-id=\"296\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/exaniii.com\/guias-que-venden-para-ceneval-fraude\/sitio_seguro\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/exaniii.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/sitio_seguro.png?fit=516%2C157&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"516,157\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"sitio_seguro\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Sitio Seguro&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/exaniii.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/sitio_seguro.png?fit=300%2C91&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/exaniii.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/sitio_seguro.png?fit=516%2C157&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-296\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Safe place<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2.- The contact information of the site is poor and not detailed<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Sites that ask you for money but you can&#8217;t communicate with them by phone or they don&#8217;t have an office, isn&#8217;t that suspicious?<\/p>\n<p>Fraudulent sites always try to hide their contact information or it is not detailed, this is so that people who fall for the scam do not have enough tools to search for them or to file a lawsuit for legal life, without information, once they you were scammed it is impossible to find the people responsible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do I know it&#8217;s probably a fraud site?

class=\"wp-caption-text\">At first glance, this other site is very nice, it is attractive and it even has testimonials, and everything that a page needs to generate trust, but because it does not have a telephone number, offices, worker data, everything seems very transparent, but the truth is that you only communicate with them through a form, if they scam you they may simply not answer you.<\/p>\n<h3>3.- Movements in social networks.<\/h3>\n<p>This is a very good practice, it consists of seeing before buying what other people say and what better medium than social networks.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sales pages that do not have social networks<\/strong> It is one more reason to distrust, because there is not even a real person who guarantees you that he bought the guide and that it worked for him, in addition the fraud pages always try to stay in the shade, their contact channels are normally only through their website, to avoid being investigated.<\/li>\n<li><strong>If the sales page has social networks<\/strong>you have to check your movement:\n<ul>\n<li>Check the comments of other people, if the page does not have comments, it is very likely that the fraud page deletes them for convenience so that others cannot know that it is fraud, or probably the page blocks the option that allows other people to write comments .<\/li>\n<li>It is also important to review what they publish and how often, fraud sites almost do not publish, that is, they have abandoned social networks, or in any case all they publish is to encourage you to buy their study guides, to find one more victim.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4.- Investigate the site before buying.<\/h3>\n<p>My recommendation is that at least before buying you have testimonials from real people who certify that their guides work, and by real I mean Testimonials that you can&#8217;t find on their own website or written by them. Investigating you will realize that those sites that seemed reliable, are totally a scam:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-299\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652817883_230_Are-guides-that-sell-for-ceneval-a-fraud.png\" alt=\"ceneval-guides-fraud\" width=\"823\" height=\"673\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-299\" data-attachment-id=\"299\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/exaniii.com\/guias-que-venden-para-ceneval-fraude\/ceneval-guias-fraude\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/exaniii.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/ceneval-guias-fraude.png?fit=823%2C673&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"823,673\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ceneval-guias-fraude\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;ceneval-guias-fraude&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/exaniii.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/ceneval-guias-fraude.png?fit=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/exaniii.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/ceneval-guias-fraude.png?fit=823%2C673&amp;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">As you can see, not everything is what it seems.<\/p>\n<h3>5.- The worst payment methods.<\/h3>\n<p>Sites that plainly want to maintain the anonymity of a payment and so you would be more sure that it is a scam are sites that only allow your payment through:<\/p>\n<p>These sites typically avoid deposits to bank accounts, where the bank can trace that person&#8217;s real name.<\/p>\n<h3>If you are going to risk buying in a place like this<\/h3>\n<p>You have already been warned but if you are still going to risk buying on one of these sites, do the community a favor, post your comment describing the site you bought from and your experience, if it is possible to put a photo as proof, believe me That all the users who read this article will thank you.<\/p>\n<p>Some users have already told me that cenevalguias.com and ceneval.net are fraudulent sites, either they don&#8217;t send you anything or what they send you are the same free guides published by ceneval or just a compilation of books.<\/p>\n<p>Help us detect more fraud sites.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for visiting us and remember that on this site all the guides are free, you may not find them all yet, but every day we try to extend our content<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are endless sites that &#8220;sell&#8221; you the guide of your dreams, a answered guide that will guarantee that you pass and prevent you from reading the 1000 books recommended by CENEVAL.
