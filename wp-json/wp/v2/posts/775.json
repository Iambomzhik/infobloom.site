Digital artists, musicians and even the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, jumped on the wave with millionaire earnings. Although NFTs do not change how we do journalism or art, they do transform what we understand by property, <strong>turning the internet into a hunting ground for collectibles.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_2\">NFTs are data units that certify the authenticity of a digital object that are stored on a blockchain network, a distributed digital storage system that is impossible to hack for all intents and purposes. Unique and impossible to modify, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain, a cryptocurrency that allows this information to be stored.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_3\">The rise of these tokens <strong>it allows digital content, which is in itself replicable, to be unique and salable.<\/strong> Memes, paintings, songs, columns&#8230; everything is capable of becoming digital investments. There may be many identical copies of a digital content, but only one is labeled by an NFT as the original.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_4\">The NFTs began to ring during the summer of 2020 when the socialite <strong>Paris Hilton<\/strong> sold a digital painting through an auction on an Ethereum platform.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_5\">Hilton is a strong supporter of NFTs, as she believes they democratize art and create a direct relationship between artists and fans. From then on, others followed in her footsteps.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_6\">Rock band Kings of Leon released a music album as NFTs, the NBA basketball league released several clips as NFTs, and artist Mikel Winkelmann, also called Beeple, took home $69.3 million ($57.4 million). euros) for a JPG file, breaking all records. And the market for NFTs continues to grow.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_7\">Dorsey, founder of Twitter, sold the first tweet ever made for 2.9 million dollars (2.41 million euros), the Associated Press auctioned an artistic piece as NFT, Quartz launched with the first article as this type of token and the New York Times He took half a million dollars (just over 400,000 euros) for a column.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_8\">There is something revolutionary about NFTs. They convert replicable content into original and unique content, safeguarded by blockchain technology. We can possess something that previously did not admit possession because it is identically replicable at infinitum.<strong> The owner has an investment and the artist monetizes his work. <\/strong>They allow you to possess something unique that by its very nature did not admit uniqueness. NFTs appeal to our need to possess, to own a piece of the world, in this case the digital world. Like a Picasso, they become currency.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"content__blockquote\">\n<p class=\"blockquote__quote\">We can possess something that previously did not admit possession because it is replicable identically &#8216;at infinitum&#8217;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"paragraph_9\">Now, for a digital product to be sold as NFT<strong> it will depend on whether investors consider it collectible<\/strong>. Because let&#8217;s remember that not everything is: we want to save the cover of the New York Times on the death of the American president <strong>John F. Kennedy,<\/strong> but not just any day. The sale will also depend on the appetite of investors, which, at the moment, is copious as prices are expected to rise in the future.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_10\">Also, not all producers will want to auction their work since selling an NFT has fixed costs. You first have to create a digital wallet to store the tokens, then generate an empty wallet for the Ethereum currency, find an auction site, connect the digital image (art piece) to the token, and pay the fees\u2014sometimes more than 100 dollars (more than 80 euros), many around 50 dollars (more than 40 euros). For the auction to be profitable, the NFT has to sell for more than these costs.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_11\">Every revolution has its<strong> Achilles&#8217; heel and that of blockchain systems is environmental.<\/strong> This technology requires millions of computers to be running non-stop so that transactions are recorded without intermediaries and are indestructible. Not surprisingly, then, creating an NFT token generates almost as much CO2 as traveling 1,000 kilometers by car.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_12\">It is too early to tell how NFTs will transform media and entertainment beyond monetization. But the rise of blockchain-based products has only just begun. It will end up changing all sectors, although it remains to be seen how.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_13\">*** Josep Valor is a professor at the IESE Business School and Carmen Arroyo is a researcher at IESE and a financial journalist at Euromoney Institutional Investor in New York.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"follow-topics-title\"><\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In March, one word flooded Twitter, Instagram and the headlines of all headers: NFTs or non-fungible tokens, for its acronym in English.
