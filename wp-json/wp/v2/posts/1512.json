Collect up to $1000 in commissions and travel the world.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<li>Beware of job offers that ask you for something in advance or that to request the interview you call a special rate Telephone: 803, 806, 807, 905, etc.<br \/>\n<blockquote><p>Example:<br \/>We facilitate work at home advertising activity by enveloping: Profitable from the beginning, copy, send texts, very simple.  You can get a bonus.  A serious company pays you for the work done, no matter where you live, it is offered throughout Spain.  No experience necessary.  You can combine it with your current job.  Interested parties send your request for information, indicating full name and address, along with two postage stamps of 0.43 cts.  to the post office box<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<li>Be wary if the seller asks you to email your credit card information.  In no case should you send your credit card data: card number, security code, expiration date, name of the holder, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Try to request as much information as possible from the seller: address, telephone number (if possible landline), etc.  check that there are no inconsistencies in the data.  For example, that the province in which the seller is located coincides with the prefix of the telephone number.  That the seller does not give you a phone number or tells you that he does not have it is something that should put you on alert.  Finally, search for seller information on Google by entering the email address or phone number and looking at the references that appear.  You will be able to see among other things if there is any complaint about him.<\/li>\n<li>Before initiating any type of payment, try to speak on the phone with the seller (fraudsters do not usually get on the phone or the phone they give does not exist)<\/li>\n<li>Never pay in advance if you are not sure of the identity of the buyer.  For more security you can use the payment on delivery with verification of the article.  Be even more suspicious if, while the seller is abroad, he asks you to make a transfer in advance using a bank that you do not know (generally they are not banks, but companies that only transfer money between countries).  Ultimately, make sure it&#8217;s not an anonymous account and ask for all the details from the account holder.<\/li>\n<li>Work at home ads are usually not worth your time.  Be very wary of ads that promise huge annual salaries: they often demand expensive upfront costs with no guarantees.  You risk wasting money, time and energy.  (in the United States they have been using this technique for some time and they warn of the problems)<\/li>\n<li>Find out if what you want to buy is sold by someone near where you live, so you can do the sale in person and see or try what you buy before paying for it.  In bulletin boards you can see the announcements in your neighborhood.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><u>Common scams:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Job offers for which to arrange an interview you have to call a premium rate number: 803, 806, 807, 905, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Sale of luxury items: Watches, bags, etc.  if the price is very low, they are usually replicas of the originals.<\/li>\n<li>Sale of second-hand vehicles: Once contacted, the seller explains why the price is so cheap (always related to some issue of separation, economic problems, etc.) and that the vehicle is in another country.  It is also common for the seller to be on a trip and not return to Spain soon.  In the end they will ask us for a transfer of a small amount as an excuse to pay paperwork or send the car.  If we make the transfer the vehicle will never arrive.<\/li>\n<li>Contact ads: in which they ask you to send an sms to contact.  Once the SMS was sent, we received another one saying that they could not read it correctly and asking us to send it again.  Ace several times with different excuses.<\/li>\n<li>Holiday home rental: usually the ad is for a villa on the coast at a relatively low price.  Once the advertiser is contacted, he tells us that he is abroad, usually in England, and asks us to make a transfer in advance for the reservation of the holiday home.  They don&#8217;t usually give the phone number and if they do, it&#8217;s wrong and they don&#8217;t usually give details of the account holder either, or they are false.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong><u>In case you are the seller<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>One of the most common scams that we have to be aware of when we decide to sell something second-hand online are false buyers.  Their way of acting is as follows: First they send an email showing their interest in the property advertised and asking us for our account details to pay by bank transfer;  then they notify us of the completion of the transfer and ask us to send the object immediately.  The scam is that the information they send us about having made the transfer is false and the money never reaches our account.\n<p>A common feature in this type of scam is that the emails are written in English or French and they always ask for bank details.<\/p>\n<p>Examples:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello Seller, I&#8217;m Dr John Bulluck from United Kingdom.  It&#8217;s my pleasure to realize this your advertised item fit my exact search.  Firstly let me confirm if this product (s) is available for shipment overseas as i&#8217;ll love to buy the item as Charity support to a Charity organization located outside the United State.  I&#8217;ll offer you 500.00 for this product including cost of freight to the Destination.  Also i&#8217;ll like to make payment via international bank transfer\/payment from my BANK or via PayPal, so if my offer is accepted, do get back to me with your preferred payment option.  if by bank transfer, do email with your bank account.  Bank Name, Account holder&#8217;s name,Bank Country, Account Number,IBan or Swift,if by PayPal do email me your PayPal account email address.<\/p>\n<p>Dear seller, I saw your item and will like to know if still available for sale and the present condition of this item and get back to me with the total cost alongside your payment information because the item is urgently needed&#8230;Hope to read from you soon&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Bonjour Mr ou Mme, je suis Mr Perrier armel homme d&#8217;affaire, Franais de nationalit, je voudrais avoir plus de details consernant votre annonce, je vous prie donc de bien vouloir me donner les details consernant la vente de votre maison et si possible quelque photos yes interresente, I never ache achet de maison et j&#8217;ai pas de notaire.  J&#8217;attends de vous lire au plus vite&#8230;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/li>\n<li>Sending bad checks: The buyer sends us a check (usually for a value greater than the agreed price), and later asks us to send him the difference.  The problem is that days after depositing the check, the Bank rejects it due to insufficient funds.  With which we not only lose the article but the amount returned to the false buyer.<\/li>\n<li>Buying second-hand cars.  In this case, a supposed buyer, usually from Africa, sends us an email saying that he wanted to buy a second-hand car for his son who was in Italy and that his birthday was coming up, so he urged him and wanted to close the transaction as soon as possible. , even paid a little more than what was requested&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>And above all, choose a trusted site.  At tablondeanuncios.com we review all ads daily before publishing them.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>What do I do if I think I&#8217;ve been scammed?<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>  The first thing you can do to confirm if you have been the target of a scam is to contact the customer service of the website where you had the ad.  They will be able to give you some guidance on what to do.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, you can always choose between reporting it to the computer crimes unit of the National Police or the Civil Guard.  The Mossos dEsquadra (in Catalonia) and the Ertzaintza (in the Basque Country) also collect reports of these crimes, in the indicated Autonomous Communities.<\/p>\n<p>This article has been written by the customer service team atTablondeanuncios.com.
