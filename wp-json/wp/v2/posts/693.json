Among the millions of legitimate websites vying for attention are websites created for all sorts of malicious purposes, from identity theft to credit card fraud.<\/p>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">These scam websites operate in a variety of ways, from posting misleading information to promising amazing rewards through a financial exchange.  Some are designed to look like trustworthy and legitimate sites, such as pages run by government organizations.  However, their goal is always the same: to extract personal and financial information.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"width: 650px; height: auto; padding: .5em 0 .5em 0;\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653012671_379_what-are-they-and-how-to-avoid-them.jpg\"><\/p>\n<h2 xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Fake site detection<\/h2>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Fortunately, there are plenty of easy ways to protect yourself from scam websites and keep your family (and your wallet) safe when you&#8217;re on the web.  Although it seems like a somewhat obvious tip, you should pay special attention to the design and writing of the website.  Does it have the type of design and quality of writing that you expect from a legitimate website?<\/p>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Look for signs such as misspellings, unnatural or incorrect language, or very obvious grammatical errors (for example, the incorrect use of singular and plural words).  On the other hand, legitimate business websites often have certain basic pages, such as a contact section and a company information page.  If you&#8217;re not sure, make a phone call to the company&#8217;s number.  If the number is from a mobile phone or you do not receive an answer, you should be alert.  There may be a reason why the company does not want to communicate verbally with the customer.<\/p>\n<h2 xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Domain name review<\/h2>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Sites designed to impersonate legitimate sites often use domain names that have addresses that are similar in appearance or pronunciation to the original ones.  For example, the address might be FBI.com or FBI.org, instead of the original: FBI.gov.  Pay special attention to addresses ending in .net or .org, as these domain names are not commonly used on online shopping sites.<\/p>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">If you want to dig deeper, you can check out who registered the domain name or URL on different sites like LookWhoIs.net and Whois.net.  These searches do not have an associated cost.<\/p>\n<h2 xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Be careful what payment method you use<\/h2>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">A good practice is to never pay anything by direct bank transfer.  If you transfer funds to a bank account and the transaction is part of a scam, you may never see your money again.  When you pay by credit card you get a certain degree of protection in case things go wrong.<\/p>\n<h2 xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Too good to be true?<\/h2>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">The promise of luxuries that exceed your greatest expectations in exchange for a few minutes of your time or a minimum of effort is a fairly effective fraudulent practice, which has existed since the days when traveling charlatans sold medicinal products of dubious effectiveness to the uninformed. people of the Far West.  Therefore, you should always ask yourself if the offer is too good to be true.<\/p>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Do they offer tablets, PCs or designer shoes at a price that is undoubtedly too low and hard to believe?  Is it a website selling a medicinal product that promises to build muscle or help you lose an incredible amount of weight in just two weeks?  Or do they offer a foolproof way to become a millionaire?  If you think something is too good to be true, it probably is.<\/p>\n<h2 xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Look on the Internet<\/h2>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">If you&#8217;re still unsure of a website&#8217;s credibility, look for other people&#8217;s online reviews of that page.  A reputation, whether good or bad, spreads across the Internet in a matter of seconds.  If someone has had a bad experience with a website, chances are they left a comment online.  Look for reviews on sites like Trustpilot, Feefo or Sitejabber and see if other users have been scammed through the website in question.<\/p>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">If you don&#8217;t find negative reviews, don&#8217;t immediately think it&#8217;s safe, as a scam website could be new.  Take into account all the factors exposed above and make sure you are not the first victim.<\/p>\n<h2 xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Always use a secure connection<\/h2>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">When you visit a legitimate site that requests financial or protected information, the company name and a lock icon should appear next to the URL in the navigation bar.  This indicates that you are connected through a secure connection.  If you do not find this symbol or the browser warns you that the site does not have an updated security certificate, you are in the presence of an important alarm signal.  To improve your level of personal protection and have an additional layer of security, always use top-tier software.<\/p>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">On the other hand, don&#8217;t take anything for granted and don&#8217;t click on links to open websites.  Instead of clicking on them, type the web address manually or bookmark the site.  Unscrupulous operators often buy domain names that sound or look similar at first glance.  If you write them manually or save the correct versions in your favorites, you will have an additional method of protection.<\/p>\n<p xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">Another convenient option is to use a feature like Safe Money for a little extra peace of mind when making payments online.<\/p>\n<h2 itemprop=\"headline\">Scam Websites: What They Are and How to Avoid Them<\/h2>\n<p>Kaspersky<\/p>\n<p>Scam websites have different ways of operating, from posting false information to promising incredible rewards for little effort.
