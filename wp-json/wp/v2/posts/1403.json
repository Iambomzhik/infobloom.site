Many new projects have emerged, countless collections of NFTs and new spaces under the name of the metaverse have gained relevance and a prominent place in news portals around the world.  However, this scenario has also given rise to <b>the number of people who have suffered some type of scam grows,<\/b> that have <b>lost their investment due to ignorance or lack of education.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>As a general rule, the first purchase of cryptocurrency that a person makes is by recommendation.
