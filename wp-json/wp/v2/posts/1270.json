Fraud is committed by those who, for profit, use enough deceit to produce an error in another, inducing him to carry out an act of disposition to his own or another&#8217;s detriment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 248.1 of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The fraud <strong>may fall on movable or immovable property, rights and services<\/strong>.  The legally protected asset is the heritage.  Nevertheless, <strong>deception is essential for this crime to be committed<\/strong>for which part of the doctrine believes that good faith and legal traffic relations are also protected.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, it is a <strong>intentional crime of result<\/strong> (the production of an economically evaluable damage), which can also be committed in an attempt degree.  The active subject can be anyone, while the active subject must be a person with a legally recognized minimum capacity to dispose of things.<\/p>\n<p>Article 248.2 also includes the <strong>specific assumptions that constitute a crime of fraud<\/strong>.  They are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a <strong>computer manipulation<\/strong> to obtain a non-consensual transfer of any property asset.<\/li>\n<li>The manufacture, introduction, possession or provision of <strong>Software<\/strong> especially aimed at committing scams.<\/li>\n<li>Operations of any kind using <strong>credit or debit cards and traveler&#8217;s checks<\/strong> to carry out operations to the detriment of its owner or a third party.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2. They are also considered guilty of fraud:<\/p>\n<p>a) Those who, for profit and using some computer manipulation or similar artifice, achieve a non-consensual transfer of any patrimonial asset to the detriment of another.<\/p>\n<p>b) Those who manufacture, introduce, possess or facilitate computer programs specifically intended for the commission of the fraud provided for in this article.<\/p>\n<p>c) Those who, using credit or debit cards, or traveler&#8217;s checks, or the data contained in any of them, carry out operations of any kind to the detriment of their owner or a third party.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 248.2 of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>The elements of the crime of fraud<\/h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court has established a list of <strong>main elements of the crime of fraud<\/strong>.  Are six:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Concurrent or precedent deception<\/strong>.  Deception is the element that differentiates the crime of fraud from other property criminal types.  It can be produced by an action, an omission, silence or inactivity, and must occur before and during the commission of the crime.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sufficient, enough and proportional deception<\/strong>.  The deception must be proportional to the purpose pursued by the perpetrator of the crime.  In addition, it must have the appearance of seriousness and reality sufficient to mislead people of perspicacity and average diligence.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Provoking error in the other party<\/strong>.  The deception must cause an error in the victim, which acts as a consequence of her ignorance or her inaccurate or distorted knowledge of reality.  Therefore, the motive for his action is flawed from the start.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Act of disposition of the victim<\/strong>.  The act of disposition can be an action or omission of the victim that generates a patrimonial movement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>profit motive<\/strong>.  The author must necessarily have the intention of obtaining an economic advantage.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Causal link or causal relationship<\/strong>.  The deception and the patrimonial damage of the victim must be related, insofar as the damage is a consequence of the deception.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>In what cases is fraud considered a minor crime?<\/h2>\n<p>A minor offense of minor fraud occurs <strong>when the value of the defrauded does not exceed 400 euros<\/strong>.  Thus, the previous lack of fraud disappears after the reform of the Penal Code of 2015.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the amount of the defrauded does not exceed 400 euros, the penalty of a fine of one to three months will be imposed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 249 of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>The crime of aggravated fraud<\/h2>\n<p>The <strong>article 250 includes the specific aggravating factors of the crime of fraud<\/strong>.  These are aggravating circumstances different from those established by the general rules of the Penal Code.<\/p>\n<p>The crime of aggravated fraud will be committed in the following cases:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>When the scam falls on basic necessities, homes or other goods of recognized social utility.<\/li>\n<li>If it is perpetrated by abusing the signature of another, or by subtracting, hiding or disabling, in whole or in part, any process, file, protocol or public or official document of any kind.<\/li>\n<li>If it affects assets that make up the historical, artistic, cultural or scientific heritage.<\/li>\n<li>When it is especially serious, taking into account the entity of the damage and the economic situation in which it leaves the victim or his family.<\/li>\n<li>When the value of the fraud exceeds 50,000 euros or when it affects a large number of people.<\/li>\n<li>If it is committed with abuse of the personal relationships between the victim and the fraudster, or if the perpetrator takes advantage of his business or professional credibility.<\/li>\n<li>When procedural fraud is committed, that is, when evidence is manipulated in a judicial process in order to cause an error in the judge so that he issues a resolution that harms the economic interests of the other party or a third party.<\/li>\n<li>If the culprit has been sentenced executorily for at least three crimes of fraud.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Also, <strong>the fraud will be especially serious in two cases<\/strong>: if circumstances 4, 5, 6 or 7 concur with 1 and when the value of the fraud exceeds 250,000 euros.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. The crime of fraud will be punished with prison sentences of one to six years and a fine of six to twelve months, when:<\/p>\n<p>1. Falls on basic necessities, homes or other goods of recognized social utility.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00ba It is perpetrated by abusing the signature of another, or by subtracting, concealing or disabling, in whole or in part, any process, file, protocol or public or official document of any kind.<\/p>\n<p>3. Falls on goods that make up the artistic, historical, cultural or scientific heritage.<\/p>\n<p>4. Special gravity review, taking into account the entity of the damage and the economic situation in which it leaves the victim or his family.<\/p>\n<p>5th The value of the fraud exceeds 50,000 euros, or affects a large number of people.<\/p>\n<p>6th It is committed with abuse of the personal relationships between the victim and the fraudster, or the latter takes advantage of their business or professional credibility.<\/p>\n<p>7th Procedural fraud is committed.  The same is incurred by those who, in a judicial procedure of any kind, manipulate the evidence on which they intend to base their allegations or use another analogous procedural fraud, causing an error in the judge or court and leading him to issue a resolution that harms the economic interests of the other party or a third party.<\/p>\n<p>8.\u00ba When committing the crime, the culprit would have been sentenced executorily for at least three crimes included in this Chapter.  Records that have been or should be canceled will not be taken into account.<\/p>\n<p>2. If the circumstances included in numerals 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th concur with those of numeral 1 of the previous section, prison sentences of four to eight years and a fine of twelve to twenty-four months.  The same penalty will be imposed when the value of the fraud exceeds 250,000 euros.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 250 of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>The improper scam<\/h2>\n<p>In the <strong>article 251<\/strong> a series of actions are collected that the doctrine considers as improper fraud.  in these behaviors <strong>the profit motive and economic damage concur, but the other elements do not have to occur<\/strong> essentials of the common scam.  The following facts are considered improper scams:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alienate, encumber or lease to another a movable or immovable thing to the detriment of the latter or a third party.<\/li>\n<li>The disposition of a movable or immovable thing hiding its charges or when, having alienated it as free, it is encumbered or alienated again before the final transfer to the acquirer, to the detriment of the latter or a third party.<\/li>\n<li>The granting of a simulated contract to the detriment of another, which the doctrine calls documentary fraud, fraudulent falsehood or simulation of fraud.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. Whoever, falsely attributing to a movable or immovable thing the power to dispose of which he lacks, either because he has never had it or because he has already exercised it, alienates, encumbers or leases it to another, to the detriment of the latter or a third party. .<\/p>\n<p>2nd The one who disposes of a movable or immovable thing concealing the existence of any charge on it, or the one who, having disposed of it as free, encumbers or disposes of it again before the final transfer to the purchaser, to the detriment of the latter, or from a third party.<\/p>\n<p>3rd The one who grants a simulated contract to the detriment of another.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 251 of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>The crime of fraud committed by legal persons<\/h2>\n<p>Legal persons can also commit a crime of fraud by virtue of what is indicated in the <strong>article 31 bis<\/strong>.  In addition to the fines, also <strong>they may be imposed the following accessory penalties contemplated in article 33.7<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dissolution of the legal person.<\/li>\n<li>Suspension of its activities for a period that may not exceed five years.<\/li>\n<li>Closure of its premises and establishments for a term that may not exceed five years.<\/li>\n<li>Prohibition (temporary or definitive) to carry out in the future the activities in whose exercise the crime has been committed, favored or covered up.<\/li>\n<li>Disqualification to obtain subsidies and public aid, to contract with the public sector and to enjoy tax or Social Security benefits and incentives, for a term that may not exceed fifteen years.<\/li>\n<li>Total or partial judicial intervention to safeguard the rights of workers or creditors for the time deemed necessary, which may not exceed five years.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When, in accordance with the provisions of article 31 bis, a legal person is responsible for the crimes included in this Section, the following penalties will be imposed:<\/p>\n<p>a) A fine of three to five times the amount defrauded, if the crime committed by the individual has a prison sentence of more than five years.<\/p>\n<p>b) Fine of double to four times the amount defrauded, in all other cases.<br \/>Following the rules established in article 66 bis, the judges and courts may also impose the penalties set forth in letters b) to g) of section 7 of article 33.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 251 bis of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Criminal lawyer specialized in fraud crimes<\/h2>\n<p>I have extensive experience as a criminal defense attorney.
