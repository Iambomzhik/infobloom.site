They apply certain modalities, they usually apply it in the financial world and some of those people who have to do with real estate or nearby property damage, liquid money that is at home, watches, jewelry, etc. Involve to remove them from the legal property of the victim. There are many types of fraud, perhaps a thousand,\u201d Salvador Guerrero Chipr\u00e9s, president of the Citizen Council, explained in an interview.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, this agency announced that from January 2018 to March 2019, 9,374 reports were registered on its hotline. The most denounced is the \u201cPrize Winner\u201d fraud with 3,648 complaints, which consists of \u201cone being known as a prize winner, the victim receives a call or a message. They tell him that he is an award winner. They obfuscate him with the story that he is privileged by luck and the universe and he begins to get wrapped up in that story to the point where he ends up depositing money at a convenience store or somewhere else, and there may be one, two, or three deposits until who ends up understanding that this can only be a farce\u201d, says Guerrero Chipr\u00e9s.<\/p>\n<p>Next, the second most common is \u201cRelative coming to visit\u201d. This has a total of 2 thousand 111 reports in the same period. Specifically in this scam, a person is led to believe that his distant relative, perhaps living in the United States, will visit him in Mexico City, but needs money to complete the journey or a loan.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPhotography: DIEGO SIM\u00d3N S\u00c1NCHEZ\/ EL UNIVERSAL<\/p>\n<p>In third place, by incidence, is the &#8220;Sale and Purchase on the Internet&#8221; scam with 1,555 complaints. In these cases, all kinds of products that are usually expensive in the market are offered at low prices. For example, a suit, a car or even a house. So, when a person calls the number that appears on a certain website, they are asked for a deposit to set aside said product, since it is coveted and the only one in existence.<\/p>\n<p>In fourth place, with 1,166 complaints, is the \u201cinjured, injured or detained person\u201d scam, which consists of criminals making phone calls claiming that they are a figure of authority or that they have some power to help that family member who supposedly was present in a crash, or committed a foul and will be detained.<\/p>\n<p>In fifth position is the &#8220;Employer in trouble&#8221;, also known as &#8220;La Patrona&#8221;, the same fraud that was recently disclosed by the Citizen Council, since according to their complaint line, they have 846 reports.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, repetitive calls are made to the domestic workers to obtain information and personal data of the inhabitants of said house.<\/p>\n<p>Then, the criminals pose as authorities such as Public Ministries, Treasury officials; or lawyers and accountants to make the victim believe that their employer has a problem. Then they manipulate them so that they do not give notice to the &#8220;bosses&#8221; and also, look in the chamber for a &#8220;yellow envelope&#8221; that contains valuables, or a safe.<\/p>\n<p>When the maids have such belongings, they are persuaded to put everything in a black bag for delivery.<\/p>\n<p>To commit fraud, alerts the president of the Citizen Council, there is a prior investigation of the victim that is done through social networks, telephone calls, or data collection in the areas where they are usually found: \u201cIn all cases there is a part of survey, research, review of your networks, face-to-face knowledge of where you live. In all cases there is a set of elements of familiarity of information that make a story believable\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"width: 567px; height: 349px;\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652697744_593_The-6-most-common-frauds-in-CDMX\u2026-how-they-can.jpg\" alt=\"frauds_cdmx_0.jpg\" \/><br \/>\nPhotography: DIEGO SIM\u00d3N S\u00c1NCHEZ\/ EL UNIVERSAL<\/p>\n<p>Another type of scam that the Citizen Security Secretariat has detected is that of the \u201cMarine or military hitch\u201d, as explained by \u00c9dgar Mart\u00ednez, from the Cyber \u200b\u200bPolice.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically in this type of scam, men and women over 40 or older adults who are divorced or widowed are victims. Here, the first contact is usually made through the Tinder mobile application and later, when there is trust, it is transferred to text messages, WhatsApp or Messenger of the Facebook social network.<\/p>\n<p>The modus operandi is to make the victim believe that she has a sentimental relationship with a United States soldier or marine and that he, in love, decides to leave everything in his country to move to Mexico. In that move, the alleged couple sends a luggage with gifts, cash that the victim must collect. At that point, he makes up the story that said suitcase got stranded due to improperly made tax payments.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"width: 566px; height: 720px;\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/The-6-most-common-frauds-in-CDMX\u2026-how-they-can.gif\" alt=\"numeralia complaint\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Guerrero Chipr\u00e9s issues three recommendations to avoid being a victim of fraud: \u201ceverything that is too easy, cheap, is false; everything that is an emergency in which I cannot verify the veracity of the information, or its objectivity, is fraud; In all cases I have to train as a citizen because it is impossible for there to be a police officer and a public prosecutor for each case\u201d.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Martin received a call.
