A user reported on Facebook that someone contacted her about something she was selling, and that she was going to make a bank transfer to secure it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">The scam was not long in coming: the alleged buyer called her desperate because <b>Instead of 10,000 pesos, \u201che got confused\u201d and sent him 100,000.<\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">\u201cIn the minutes <b>They call me from the &#8216;Bank&#8217;, and they begin to give me the step by step that I should follow<\/b>they came to us at the same time as the call from the Santander code and they kept asking me to dictate it to them and thus they managed to block my homebanking to which we were unable to gain further access and when we went to the ATM we realized that they had emptied us completely the account\u201d, detailed the woman in an extensive post.<\/p><source type=\"image\/jpg\" media=\"(max-width: 728px)\" \/><source type=\"image\/jpg\" media=\"(max-width: 1023px)\" \/><source type=\"image\/jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">In addition to stealing the money from the account, they also took a bank loan, something that the Central Bank began to regulate very recently, and even made a transfer of 10,000 pesos through Mercado Pago.<\/p>\n<p class=\"interstitial--link margin_top-md margin_bottom-md\">\/\/ Banking scams: the new controls of the Central Bank and keys to avoid being victims of cybercriminals<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">\u201cI am destroyed, they did not just steal money from us, they have stolen the effort of a long time at the cost of work and the hardest, believe me.

But they didn&#8217;t even have to &#8220;hack&#8221; his home banking: he made the transfer to the scammers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph\">Juan Pablo posted an armchair he owned on an online sales site.  He asked for 12 thousand pesos.  A person was interested in acquiring the piece of furniture and thus began a<b> exchange of messages via WhatsApp<\/b>.  After agreeing, he received a message that closed the agreement.  \u201cJuan, there my wife made the transfer to you.  I am working.
