In short, when I went to work they gave me a useless training where they only give you two plans, one inflated, with monthly payments and commissions that exceed those of any car agency and later the supposed promotion that is handled at your convenience because all year you have those benefits, that is the first deception, <\/p>\n<p>but at first glance it is not such a bad thing since many companies do the same, but the real deception is based on people&#8217;s ignorance, this sounds very bad but it is the truth, on the part of the manager there is a lot of pressure because If you don&#8217;t sell, you are not profitable for Autofin Monterrey, and when you work for commissions, you have the pressure of having to generate sales in order to have economic income. <\/p>\n<p>The policy of this financial car Autofin Monterrey is if the client does not ask you, you do not have to tell him, it is assumed that to obtain financing or self-financing for a car, you need to meet a series of requirements, such as: proof of income that covers more than four times the monthly payments of the car they want, a property tax bill necessarily in the name of the credit holder, and if the property they wish to acquire exceeds the amount of 250 thousand pesos or they do not necessarily have any of the previous documents They will require a guarantee with a property in their name. <\/p>\n<p>But here comes something very important, that those documents are going to be requested until the car is handed over to them, when supposedly they are going to make the request for the unit to Monterrey, but by then the people who with great enthusiasm They want to have their car and have already been giving several monthly contributions through auto financing or a down payment to take their car faster, but seeing that they do not meet the requirements and cannot get any guarantee, they dissent to cancel the credit and that is when The great profits of these people come, since at the moment of requesting the return of their money, the penalties come that can increase up to 100% of what they have already contributed, here the comment that the ignorance of the people is what makes millionaires to these people who own so many defrauding companies, because to begin with they sign a contract with many small letters where many times it says things that are very different from what  that sales consultants promise them. <\/p>\n<p>At least once a week, the professor&#8217;s staff went to the Autofin Monterrey branch to follow up on one of the many cases of complaints against Autofin Monterrey, but everything is already very well prepared because they keep a file with a copy of all the documents that the clients with their own fist signed and at the end of the day the complaint does not proceed any more because everything plays against them of the people who approached to request financing for a car since when their signature appears on the contract they are accepting the conditions of the company and the requirements that at some point they will be asked for and the penalties that they would have for breach of contract by the clients, PROFECO staff themselves call this scam of the Autofin Monterrey company as &#8220;a legal robbery.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>It is possible to sell without hiding information from people, because there are those who meet the requirements that are asked of them and obtain their cars without so many complications, but to give them an idea of \u200b\u200bhow far the ambition of several workers reaches, regardless of the problem that can cause families who put so much effort together for a down payment or their monthly payments sign a large number of contracts per month that most of them will not be able to obtain the service for which they signed the contract, in an approximate number of contracts that are signed in the space of a month it is about 50 counts and the cars that are delivered in the same time is only approximately 4 units, there is no way to stop these companies because before the law they are not doing anything wrong, only It remains for us to have a little more culture and investigate a little more about the products or services that we want to acquire.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is a company in Mexico that operates outside the regulation of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, a well-structured scam so that the affected users do not have any way of recovering a little of how much they take from them, I am talking about Autofin_Monterrey, I worked for a few months in [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1202,"comment_status":"","ping_status":"","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1200"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1200"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1200\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1202"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1200"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1200"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1200"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
