COAs are often changed after they leave your lab.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"la-tecnologia-nft\"><strong>NFT technology<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>With this new technology, a business or consumer can scan a QR code and obtain an NFT from the COA, which is date-stamped and certified.<\/p>\n<p>For the initial delivery at Art Basel, ACS Laboratory sold about 100 NFTs at $100 each, according to Brown.<\/p>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t think of NFT gaming as a revenue generator, but instead sees it as a way to bolster consumer confidence and strengthen brand reputation.<\/p>\n<p>In an unexpected twist, ACS Laboratory is now fielding calls from consumers who want the company to produce COA NFTs for a particular strain just because that consumer might like that strain.<\/p>\n<p>Now he has a whole team working to get COAs on the blockchain.<br \/>&#8220;It&#8217;s coming full circle,&#8221; Brown said.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"como-evitar-ser-estafado\"><strong>How to avoid being scammed<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>While fraudsters exist in the NFT space, that&#8217;s no different than in the business world, Vicente Sederberg&#8217;s Welsh said.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid operating in a questionable space, he recommends that companies do as much research as possible before listing or \u201cminting\u201d NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>It also recommends that companies buy and sell tokens on OpenSea, the more established marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Welsh advises staying away from pump-and-dump scams.<\/p>\n<p>The unregulated cryptocurrency market provides an opportunity for these types of schemes, where an individual or group buys large amounts of \u201ccoins\u201d to increase demand and price.<\/p>\n<p>Those same traders exaggerate the merit of cryptocurrency in particular, often using social media platforms or influencers.<\/p>\n<p>Once investors rush to buy the coin, the same group sheds their holdings, causing prices to drop.<\/p>\n<p>The most well-known pump and dump in cryptocurrency to date occurred with a coin called EthereumMax.<\/p>\n<p>Kim Kardashian and boxer Floyd Mayweather promoted the coin through social media.<\/p>\n<p>EthereumMax has lost up to 97% of its value since June and prompted the filing of a class action lawsuit.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"las-empresas-de-cannabis-que-buscan-acunar-nft-o-crear-originales-tambien-deben-ser-conscientes-de-la-posibilidad-de-infringir-la-propiedad-intelectual-preexistente\"><strong>Cannabis companies looking to mint NFTs, or create originals, should also be aware of the potential to infringe on pre-existing intellectual property<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>For example, a series of NFTs are created to resemble a famous fashion logo, say Louis Vuitton.<\/p>\n<p>The high-end luxury company owns many trademarks, and if an NFT is launched to intentionally resemble something that is famous or well-known, expect a trademark lawsuit from the famous brand.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Just because it&#8217;s an NFT doesn&#8217;t mean IP considerations are out of the window,&#8221; Welsh said.  \u201cA lot of times, people don&#8217;t really pay attention to who owns the intellectual property.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA wave of litigation is coming at some point.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One major gray area: The NFT market is not part of the real-world legal system, and as of yet, there is no judge or courtroom in the metaverse.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related: Ways the Tech Community Is Embracing Marijuana<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yes, gentlemen, the NFT boom, as could not be imagined, is approaching the world of THC and CBD.
