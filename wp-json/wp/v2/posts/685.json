Since then, interest in all things NFT has continued to grow at breakneck speed, fueling countless pieces of digital art (some weirder than others) and grabbing headlines for their multi-million dollar valuations.  And then, of course, we have the NFT-based games, like Axie Infinity, which generate $220.3 million in monthly sales and recently raised $152 million in the Series B funding round.<\/p>\n<p>It is clear that NFTs have seen a dramatic rise.  As a rule, such success attracts the attention of innovators from all industries, who think about how to expand the applications of new technologies and make them even more lucrative.  This time is no exception.  We are now leaving the NFT lullaby to witness the emergence of dozens of variations of non-fungible tokens that serve every conceivable need for businesses and consumers.  In fact, the first batch of new \u201chot\u201d NFTs is already here.  Those are upgradable, for a limited time, and hashless.  They seem like perfect tools for artists, brands, and the metaverse: a trending concept of a shared multidimensional digital environment, the creation of which has been done by Facebook, Fortnite, Sensorium, Roblox, among several other players. <\/p>\n<p>So what are these new types of NFTs, and what exactly can they do for a metaverse?<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h-driving-collaborations-in-digital-space\">Driving collaborations in the digital space<\/h2>\n<p>As the name suggests, upgradable NFTs evolve over time, allowing multiple players to transform NFTs and their corresponding content, while refraining from ownership.  This feature is very useful for a wide range of entertainment industries.  For creators, this is a promising development that allows, for example, an artist or musician to legitimately take another creator&#8217;s artwork as a basis for their own.  This means that two (or even more) pieces of content can be rolled into one without the legal and creative headaches we see so often in the non-crypto world.  Similarly, global fashion houses can now launch collaborations without unnecessary bureaucracy or third-party involvement.  After all, Valentino, Louis Vuitton and Burberry were among the early adopters of cryptocurrencies, issuing NFTs from fully digital collections and increasingly experimenting with metaverses through virtual reality and augmented reality in the past year.<\/p>\n<h2>Facilitate smart contracts<\/h2>\n<p>Hashless NFTs allow users to save text details directly to the smart contract without the need to write a single line of code.  As a concept associated with high technology and futuristic environments, the metaverse implies convenience and lack of bureaucracy.  Hashless NFTs will significantly ease administrative procedures between all metaverse participants, from users and content creators to developers and investors. <\/p>\n<h2>Drive user engagement<\/h2>\n<p>Limited-time NFTs serve as a powerful gamification tool to drive user engagement.  With this type of NFT, companies could tokenize virtual event tickets and enhance them with advanced access and expiration settings, allowing attendees to trade them freely on the secondary market or keep them as collectibles at certain rarity levels.  For example, Fortnite could have used them as an additional long-term tool to engage attendees of its recent Ariana Grande virtual concert, some of whom complained that the event ended too soon.  Another promising application of limited-time NFTs applies to metaverses, where game assets could be tied to specific time periods.<\/p>\n<h2>The origins<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the above types of NFTs were in fact revealed by metaverse developers at Sensorium, the company behind the Sensorium Galaxy metaverse created in collaboration with Jay-Z&#8217;s Roc Nation and chart-topping artists like David Guetta and Armin Van Buren.  Upgradable, time-limited, and hashless are all features of Wakatta, Sensorium&#8217;s new blockchain designed specifically for the needs of the entertainment industry.  As announced at Token 2049 in London, Sensorium Galaxy will integrate the Wakatta blockchain within a few months to allow users to create virtual beings as NFTs and monetize their creations through a transparent marketplace.  According to Alex Blagirev, Wakatta&#8217;s project leader, the substrate-based blockchain will offer low transaction fees of $0.001 and the ability to handle thousands of transactions per second.<\/p>\n<h2>rising market<\/h2>\n<p>Although we have yet to see upgradable, time-limited, hashless NFTs in action, their future looks very promising as the market for non-fungible tokens has witnessed unprecedented success.  The versatility of NFTs and the fact that they can be integrated into a wide variety of industries has drawn investors to the technology.  In the first quarter of 2021 alone, the NFT market saw an increase of 2,100 compared to the last quarter of 2020, with sales of these tokens.  reaching over $2 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The numbers underscore the potential of NFTs, and blockchains are seizing the moment.  Carry Flow, developed by Dapper Labs following the company&#8217;s partnership with the NBA which has led to NBA Best Shot, a very popular marketplace for digital basketball collectibles.  This has earned the company more than $500 million in the first half of 2021. The company recently revealed that it will extend its NFT services to the NFL and other major sports leagues, including Spain&#8217;s LaLiga.<\/p>\n<p>Other companies following the same recipe include iconic brands like Marvel, whose first foray into the world of NFTs included the Spider-Man and Captain American digital collectibles.  Some $4 million worth of Spiderman NFTs sold out within 24 hours of release and other releases have been just as successful.<\/p>\n<p>NFT markets have enjoyed a similar boom.  According to a recent study by DappRadar, the top 30 NFT markets combined have raised a total of more than $11.53 billion.  For example, in June 2021 alone, OpenSea sold $160 million in digital assets, with a 45x increase in volume growth over the first half of 2021. MakersPlace generated more than $100 million in sales last year and was Witness Beeple&#8217;s artwork sells for $69.3 million on its platform.<\/p>\n<h2>Brilliant Future<\/h2>\n<p>According to a recent study by CB Insights, there are currently more than 90 companies involved in creating the metaverse.  As more brands turn their attention to the metaverse, either creating one or entering it to sell their products and services, the demand for NFTs and their many products will continue to grow.  Overall, NFTs remain a relatively new technology and, more importantly, a niche opportunity for businesses, investors, and users alike.  That&#8217;s the momentum new players like Wakatta are hoping to harness in this newly created market.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It was only recently that the world took notice of another craze, this time in the form of a new type of blockchain-based asset called non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.
