It is one of the acronyms of the year.  NFTs or non-fungible tokens have become one of the hottest crypto ecosystem trends of 2021 with global sales increasing 55% from $250 million to $389 million.<\/p>\n<p>As we know,<strong> NFTs are unique collectible crypto assets<\/strong>, and have been around since 2012, when the concept of Bitcoin \u201ccolored coins\u201d emerged.  These coins were simply marked satoshis, or \u201ccolored\u201d with distinctive information that linked them to real-world assets.  However, for the most part, Colored Coins were used to create and trade works of art.  The world of NFTs began to develop little by little and reached the point of exploding last year and being on everyone&#8217;s lips in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>See \u25ba What are NFTs?  What are they for?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Creating and selling your own NFTs is not a secret and you don&#8217;t have to be an expert in code or programming<\/strong> to do it because <strong>there are platforms and different ways to create them<\/strong>.  Ideal for artists, photographers, designers and more, here we share a couple of options to create non-fungible tokens and publish them for free.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The first option to create and sell your art in the form of NFT is to use the popular platform and marketplace<\/strong> Opensea.io.<\/p>\n<p>Opensea.io en <strong>THE<\/strong> place on the internet to create and sell your NFTs.  With more than 20 million works, the decentralized platform that has been operating since 2018 uses the Ethereum blockchain to create, sell, buy and exchange NFTs that are \u201cregistered\u201d in the aforementioned blockchain. <strong>Creating your own NFT or collection of NFTs on OpenSea is free of charge.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The first step<\/strong> to carry out the process is to create an account in Opensea for free and link a wallet.  The platform works with several.  MetaMask is the main one, but others such as CoinbaseWallet, Bitski and Dapper, for example, can be linked.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-205405\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/How-to-create-and-sell-your-own-NFTs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"927\" height=\"723\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Once the wallet is linked, it will be required to enter a password, <strong>digitally sign<\/strong> (with a single click) and we will be ready to create the first NFT.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The process is as simple as sending a file as an email attachment or uploading a photo to Instagram<\/strong>: you will have to look for the \u201cCreate a Collection\u201d option and a page will open to build your NFTs collection, (you will have to put a name and a \u201clogo\u201d, or cover\/profile photo) and immediately you will be able to upload the file you want to convert to NFT.  What can be an NFT?  Well, basically any digital file, as long as it&#8217;s your own and you own the rights.  What you upload will be your own responsibility.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-205399\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653234930_74_How-to-create-and-sell-your-own-NFTs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"804\" height=\"676\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>As we know, an NFT can be a photo, a digital creation, a GIF, an MP3, etc, etc\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Uploaded the file you must <strong>complete the form<\/strong> with the name, a description and some other things to better identify your NFT.<\/p>\n<p><strong>-External Link<\/strong>: a link you want.  It is attached to your NFT and allows users to click on your works, more details about the NFT or simply your personal page.<br \/><strong>-Properties:<\/strong> this is the place to \u201ccustomize\u201d your NFT, that is, add its characteristics, its type, etc, etc.<br \/><strong>-Levels and Stats:<\/strong> They work the same as Properties and are used to give your NFT more customization.  It is not mandatory to complete these fields.<\/p>\n<p>The most important option on this form is <strong>blockchain<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Because it is important?  Because here you can select in <strong>which blockchain your NFT will be inscribed on.<\/strong> If you choose Ethereum, to publish your NFT for sale you must pay a gas fee that is established according to network congestion. <strong>In order to publish and sell your NFT for free, you must select the Polygon blockchain.<\/strong> In both cases, in the event that a sale is made, Opensea charges a 2.5% commission.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-205396\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653234930_344_How-to-create-and-sell-your-own-NFTs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"108\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>And ready!

There you can enter the amount with which you want to publish and the system will automatically provide how many dollars it is equivalent to according to the ETH price of the moment, and how much the commission will be in case of making the sale.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-205404\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653234930_544_How-to-create-and-sell-your-own-NFTs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"553\" height=\"563\"  \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Clicking Complete listing<\/strong> a pop-up window will appear for<strong> \u201csign\u201d your NFT.<\/strong> This step serves to give authenticity and authorship to the NFT and \u201cadvise\u201d the system that the non-fungible token is for sale through the signature with your wallet.<\/p>\n<p>The NFT will appear in the OpenSea marketplace, ready to receive offers.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Since NFTs can be basically any digital format, there is <strong>a platform that puts up for auction for sale, tweets in the form of NFTs.<\/strong> Yes, your tweets can also be NFTs and can be bought and sold.

A) Yes,<strong> the tweet converted into NFT will be listed waiting for someone to offer an amount in ETH.<\/strong> If the quantity equals the price entered, the NFT is reserved.  If it is less, the owner will decide whether to sell it or wait for a better offer.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Of course there are many other platforms to create and sell NFTs of all kinds.  It&#8217;s just a matter of testing them and seeing how they work according to the requirements and needs of each user.  However, given so much variety, what is unanimous is that the NFT boom is a reality and a large number of artists and digital content creators are taking advantage of the wave.
