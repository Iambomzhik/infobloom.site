Perhaps these figures will change names in the not too distant future, but for now a few simple explanations of their basic functional aspects will suffice. <\/p>\n<h2 style=\"\">Origin of TEF and SPEI<\/h2>\n<p>The implementation of the SPEI (Interbank Electronic Payment System) and the TEF (Electronic Fund Transfers) is the product of <strong>an effort by Banxico to incorporate modern systematic payments<\/strong>.  This means that they comply with certain basic principles published by the BIS (Bank for International Settlements) and obey international clearing and settlement standards. <\/p>\n<p>For this reason, it was agreed to improve the laws in charge of payment systems as they present certain regulatory gaps.  This is how, in 2002, the Payment Systems Law approved by Congress was born.  Then Banxico&#8217;s Governing Board would add some key reforms to control credit risks, which would end in 2005. <\/p>\n<p>Consequently, both the TEF and the SPEI are a necessary update to what was previously known as the Extended Use Electronic Payment System (SPEUA).  These new versions are distinguished by being safer, faster, more efficient, having simpler settlement schemes, <strong>better automation of shipping and receiving processes<\/strong> and stronger platforms. <\/p>\n<h2 style=\"\">Differences between the SPEI and the TEF<\/h2>\n<p>Before expanding a little on the characteristics of the TEF and some aspects of the SPEI, we must resolve the issue of why they are different.  The simple explanation looks like this: <\/p>\n<p>What essentially varies between these forms of settlement is the time each one takes. <strong>With the Interbank Electronic Payment System, <\/strong><strong>operations are performed in real time<\/strong>, meaning in practice that it depends on the availability of the system to process them.  The instructions sent require a window for validation and subsequent execution. <\/p>\n<p>Instead, <strong>the Electronic Funds Transfer system is subject to an established schedule of 24 to 48 hours<\/strong> to make charges and payments.  It is a deferred settlement that takes place at the end of the banking institution&#8217;s operating cycle.  This payment method is not recommended for large amounts due to the risks involved in this longer period. <\/p>\n<h2 style=\"\">What do we call TEF?<\/h2>\n<p>Similar to SPEI, we can define Electronic Fund Transfers as a platform that enables the <strong>digital payment between different bank accounts<\/strong>.  This also implies that it makes unnecessary the use of documents, checks or paper money to carry out different types of commercial or personal transactions. <\/p>\n<p>TEFs have been conceived as a payment method for banks and customers to carry out digital operations safely, anonymously and with some speed.  This has not only represented a <strong>lower cost<\/strong> operational for the beneficiaries, has also allowed a <strong>further simplification<\/strong> of these sending and receiving processes. <\/p>\n<h2 style=\"\">Functioning of the TEF<\/h2>\n<p>The possibility of carrying out a TEF, the basic element implies having a bank account.  By means of the <strong>online banking<\/strong> of your preferred entity, a <strong>app for smartphone or tablet<\/strong> authorized for this, in the <strong>ATMs<\/strong> or even in the <strong>branch offices<\/strong>you have access with certain restrictions to use this tool. <\/p>\n<p>The process works like this: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The account holder, through the means indicated above, requests a digital transfer from the bank for a certain amount, indicating the recipient&#8217;s data and entering the receiving account number. <\/li>\n<li>At the time the entity receives said request, it must verify that the client has sufficient funds to carry out the operation.  If applicable, the transfer is made, you receive a notice of the time the transaction was made and also a unique identification key or tracking code. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Unlike SPEI, which requires the approval of Banxico, TEFs work through Cecoban<\/strong>which is a private company in charge of managing the data recorded by the banks and releasing the funds. <\/li>\n<li>Once the information is received from the banking institution, said company releases the money together with the data required by the receiving bank.  Thus, the depositor and beneficiary have how to locate the resources sent. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"\">What can be done with EFTs <\/h2>\n<p>In Mexico and other countries that have incorporated this efficient payment system, <strong>most frequent operations available<\/strong> are usually: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Payment of the balance for credit cards. <\/li>\n<li>Payment to suppliers who have different accounts in other banks.<\/li>\n<li>Cancellation of installments for a credit to the account of the creditor or lender.<\/li>\n<li>Payment of salaries and payroll for those workers who have assigned bank accounts.<\/li>\n<li>Deposits intended for individuals who have accounts in entities affiliated with the service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An important advantage of EFTs is that they cover the main national banks and make transfers to other countries possible.  In addition, this mechanism is enabled for your favorite devices or payment methods, such as apps installed on smartphones, cards with magnetic stripe, chip or contactless technology, tokens and electronic wallets. <\/p>\n<p>These systems complement each other to streamline electronic operations.  Our advice is that you adopt this technology without fear so that you can better organize your personal finances and save valuable time that you can use on other projects.\n<\/p>\n<p>Both the TEF and the SPEI are <strong>designed to decongest the already crowded branches of Mexican banks<\/strong> more important.  On the other hand, these platforms allow you to automate your fixed payments, make direct debits and cancel services, simplifying your life and improving your financial habits. <\/p>\n<p>While we are committed to advancing traditional banking towards more efficient, fast and secure service, we also want to promote its positive aspects.  So you are aware of how the financial system works. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When referring to the electronic payment methods most popular in the country, it is particularly important to mention the SPEI and the TEFcommon systems for business owners, entrepreneurs and people who take advantage of online banking on a daily basis.
