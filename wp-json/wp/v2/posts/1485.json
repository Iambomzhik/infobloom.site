But some people get so used to lying that they do so even when there is no clear purpose and when their lies are very easy to spot, leaving people confused by the extent of their deceptions.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, I have worked with many of these people, the so-called pathological or compulsive liars, and have gained some insight into the way they think. Incredible as it may seem, lying makes some sense if we see it through their perspective.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Lying is important&#8230;for them.<\/strong> The number one reason people lie when it just doesn&#8217;t matter is because they actually believe it does. While everyone around him believes it to be a minor matter, the liar believes it to be critically important. They are probably putting undeserved emphasis and pressure on themselves or the issue, but we won&#8217;t know unless we ask something like, &#8220;I think this issue is very important to you, why?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Telling the truth feels like giving up control. <\/strong>People often tell lies because they are trying to control the situation and influence the decisions or reactions they want. The truth can be &#8220;Inconvenient&#8221; because it might not go according to your narrative.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. They don&#8217;t want to disappoint. <\/strong>It may not feel like it, but people who tell one lie after another are often worried about losing the respect of those around them. They want to please, impress and be valued. And they worry that the truth might lead to rejection or shame.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. An avalanche of lies. <\/strong>I remember a cartoon my kids watched years ago about how lies grow. We tell a little lie, but then, to cover that lie, we have to tell another, then another, and then another, each one getting bigger and bigger. Finally, we end up arguing about the color of the sky, because admitting anything creates the potential for the entire house of cards to come crashing down. If a chronic liar admits even one lie, they feel that they are admitting to being a liar and that there is reason not to trust them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. For them it is not a lie. <\/strong>When we are under pressure, it becomes difficult to think about things in general. Our memories of things are actually very unreliable: Multiple studies have shown that our memories are influenced by many things, that they change over time and that they are practically reconstructed every time we think about them. Repetitive liars often feel so much pressure at the moment that their memory simply becomes unreliable. When they say something, it&#8217;s usually because at the time they genuinely believe it to be true. Your memory has been overwhelmed by stress, current events, and your desire to find a way to make this situation work. Sometimes that can become so severe that the person almost seems to have created an entirely alternate world in their head, one that meets their needs and beliefs from one moment to the next.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. They wish it were true. <\/strong>Finally, it may be that the liar wanted his lie to be true so badly that his desire and need again overwhelm his instinct to tell the truth. &#8220;Let&#8217;s be the change we want to see in the world&#8221;, Gandhi never really said that, but sometimes liars hope they can make something come true by repeating it over and over and believing it as much as possible. In today&#8217;s environment of &#8220;alternative facts,&#8221; it&#8217;s hard not to see this behavior as relatively justified.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"Wikimedia Commons\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653831090_167_6-reasons-why-people-lie-even-if-it-is-not.jpg\" alt=\"Wikimedia Commons\" width=\"320\" height=\"232\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Most people are honest by default. Most people tell the truth most of the time. Our language capacity is based on the assumption of honesty, we agree that the words we use consistently mean the same things, and we do not use words in a misleading way because this would make language and the very communication of ideas impossible. Some people lie more than others, but frequent liars really are honest most of the time. But when his deceptions are so blatant, easily debunked, and seemingly irrelevant, they stand out dramatically.<\/p>\n<p>As frustrating as it can be when people lie, we can begin to understand the motivations behind it. Ask the person, &#8220;Why is this situation so important to you?&#8221; or &#8220;Why do you need me to see this the way you see it?&#8221; it can be a helpful, non-threatening way to get to the foundations of despair and stress that often lie behind the deception. Let&#8217;s not ask, &#8220;Why do you lie?&#8221; We need to remember that the person is often motivated by not being seen as a liar, and this question makes them feel cornered.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, understanding the general motivations and having empathy towards these situations has value. But to function effectively in the real world, we also need people to learn to be more honest. Communicating empathy for a person&#8217;s despair can be a valuable tool for them to feel empowered to tell the truth. And then recognizing and reinforcing when someone tells the truth is a powerful way to get them to be more honest. It shows people that the truth is not scary and that the world will not end if the truth is told.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pathological lying is not a clinical diagnosis, although it can sometimes be a symptom of other problems, such as a personality disorder or a manic episode.
