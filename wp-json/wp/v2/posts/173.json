The future is here"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>NFTs are one of the most attractive industries of this decade. That is why the importance of learning to capitalize on them now. These digital assets are predicted to be part of everyone&#8217;s lives in the next five years. An NFT is a non-fungible token, that is, a digital file that is within a chain of blocks (Blockchain), which makes them completely secure.<\/p>\n<p>Santiago M\u00e1rquez, an expert on the subject, emphasizes that the main value of NFTs is that they are unhackable and cannot be modified, and they also have many associated benefits, which means that some projects have great potential for recovery.<\/p>\n<p>M\u00e1rquez says that he came to this world through cryptocurrencies and looking for different ways to invest, he came across NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey recently became a trend and I remembered the beginnings of Bitcoin in 2010 when many believed that it was a scam. I began to study and train because I saw its enormous potential and today we are all witnesses of its enormous value\u201d, he says.<\/p>\n<p>Something similar is happening with NFTs. Many people do not see the potential, but the truth is that these digital assets are here to change everything, which is why Santiago has created @elmoneyVerso a community in which his goal is to guide people to take advantage of this opportunity even if they are starting from scratch.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How can you make money with them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The immediate way to monetize NFTs is by buying a piece in a primary market and selling it in a secondary market, such as Opensea, for a higher value. The second is to create an NFT, but it requires artistic knowledge, investment, or partnering with artists interested in selling these types of pieces.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"h-lea-tambien-onlyfans-permite-el-uso-de-nft-como-imagenes-de-perfil\">Also read: OnlyFans allows the use of NFTs as profile pictures<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cNFTs allow two types of investments, take an NFT with potential and apply the Flipping method that I teach in my course (It is about buying and selling it in a few minutes or hours and generating a short-term return). The second is to buy an NFT with potential appreciation in the medium or long term, however it is also important to generate capital in the short term\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What makes NFTs different from other online businesses?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies can be exchanged and fractions can be purchased, while NFTs are single and indivisible pieces. Being represented in digital works of art they are also much more exciting than cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>Another of the digital markets is affiliate marketing, this requires a higher learning curve, it is a type of business in which the key is to become a good marketer as a profession, while NFTs are short-term investments that do not require deep technical knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>Although there are easy tools to identify good projects, and it is a simple business model to be adopted by the general public, as in everything, a step-by-step and training is required to invest well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is the training &#8220;NFTs the digital evolution&#8221; about?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a free training of four classes in which he will explain how to monetize the opportunity of NFTs and the metaverse. The first as short-term investments and the second as long-term. The training will teach all the technology behind NFTs, which is the same as cryptocurrencies, the blockchain. What is it, what is it for, what are its applications and why is the whole internet headed in that direction\u201d, explains the expert M\u00e1rquez and emphasizes that the most attractive thing is that the person is going to obtain the tools to buy and sell NTFs and generate profit.<\/p>\n<p>As preparation, a free digital book is also available that is ideal to read to arrive at the training prepared and with bases, there you will find general terms that help to better understand this world. The free course will be from February 23 to March 2.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice to give to those who have not been encouraged?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is understandable that there is fear when entering this type of virtual business, M\u00e1rquez&#8217;s advice is to look at the general picture, where that business is moving. Of course, relying on verified platforms and with the accompaniment of trained people.<\/p>\n<p>For those who have already made investments in this type of business, but it hasn&#8217;t gone very well, their advice is patience, because if you don&#8217;t have it, you can make bad decisions that lead to losing money.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, the expert reveals that his perspective is that this type of virtual environment, such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs, will not be a passing trend. They are the first step so that in the not too distant future Internet 3.0 will be as important as the one currently used.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, NFTs will be the assets of the Metaverse that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced, and that it will be the main environment where you will interact with others.<\/p>\n<p>The course will be available on the MoneyVerso page, which is the main channel that the expert M\u00e1rquez has to connect with people; News and solutions are published there so that those interested are at the forefront of this technology and make the best investment decisions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NFTs are one of the most attractive industries of this decade.
