Should individuals and businesses be wary of investment fraud and other scams using the World Bank name?<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Yes, all individuals and businesses should be careful not to fall victim to investment scams, known as &#8220;prepayments.&#8221; Some of these scams use the name or pretend to be an institution affiliated with the World Bank Group.<\/p>\n<p>Many of these scams originate in Nigeria and are therefore called \u201cNigerian scams\u201d \u200b\u200bor \u201c4-1-9\u201d letters, referring to the number of the section of the Nigerian penal code that refers to this type of scam. There are also some frauds that have been created in C\u00f4te d&#8217;Ivoire and Sierra Leone.<\/p>\n<p>Police estimate that thousands of these requests are faxed or emailed weekly to individuals and companies around the world. Only a very small fraction uses the name of the Bank.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, two new types of scams have emerged in South Africa. Requests to open a personal bank account at the Bank, even though the Bank is not a commercial financial institution, or criminals leave phone messages notifying potential victims that they have won money that they can collect at the World Bank.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Back to FAQ<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n<p><b>2. What form do these frauds take?<\/b><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The use of sophisticated letterheads and forms to send what appears to be legitimate correspondence from the World Bank Group, as well as various schemes that refer to it, is becoming more and more common. In addition, some scammers often present themselves as auditors of the institution, or as members of the World Bank Regional Office in West Africa.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, the creditors of the Governments of said region received letters via fax in which the senders affirmed that they were empowered by said Governments to settle past debts. In this case, a Bank letterhead very similar to the official one was used.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The applications typically ask potential victims to provide personal information, such as signatures or bank account details, and to pay certain up-front fees, commonly referred to as \u201cprocessing fees.\u201d In exchange, the victim is promised a certain sum of money, which is, of course, false. In some cases, scammers sign the letters with the real names of Bank staff in order to give them more credibility.<\/p>\n<p>See an example (i) (pdf) using apparently official Bank letterhead and signature.<\/p>\n<p>In South Africa, a new type of scam involves a message left on a cell phone saying that the recipient has won money to be paid by the Bank and asking to call a certain phone number to get it. This fraud was discovered when a potential victim arrived at a Bank office in a country to demand payment because the telephone number he had to contact, fortunately, did not work.<\/p>\n<p>See an example (i) (pdf) of fraud involving personal banking information.<\/p>\n<p>The institution has no involvement in these fraudulent letters and cautions the public to be very wary of these and similar requests that falsely claim to be related to the Bank or any member of the World Bank Group.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Back to FAQ<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n<p><b>3.
