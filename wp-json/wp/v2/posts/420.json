It is not in the interest of either party that the problem be solved by criminal means, so trying to solve it in private is usually a quick solution (in many cases).<\/p>\n<p>Thus, <strong>try to get in touch<\/strong> with the seller or website (or their webmaster) that scammed you. <strong>Send emails <\/strong>(it is the best weapon, since everything is in writing) or<strong> calls on the phone<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><i\/><\/p>\n<p>\t\t\tThe <strong>first step <\/strong>when you have been scammed you should always be trying <strong>get in touch<\/strong> with the seller or website (or their webmaster) that scammed you.\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve already done so but got nothing, or if you manage to talk to the seller but they refuse to acknowledge the scam, <strong>threatens to sue<\/strong> Let&#8217;s see if that changes your mind.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 Call your bank<\/h3>\n<p>It is critical that you do it in the shortest possible time, because there is still a chance that the payment will be canceled if you have bought a fake product, although if you have done it through a transfer it is more difficult.  Also call if you have been a victim of phishing or smishing so that your bank can try to <strong>block cards <\/strong>and current accounts to avoid future thefts, as well as check the possible movements of money in your account to make sure what has happened.  if you use<strong> PayPal <\/strong>you should know there is one <strong>user friendly policy<\/strong> and so the full payment will be returned if the product has not arrived or arrives in poor condition.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Change all your passwords and report the profile<\/h3>\n<p>If by any chance <strong>you have entered your personal data<\/strong> in some type of external form sent by scammers or on any platform, whether it is for sale or a social network, you have to know that once the scammers have your personal data, <strong>have access to almost everything<\/strong> what has to do with your life, social network accounts, your identity data, bank accounts.  With this they can <strong>Impersonate your identity which entails a serious danger<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<p>They have very valuable information that will be worth them for a long time but do not make their job easy and once you have detected the fraud try to change the passwords of your account.  If you have entered the <strong>credit card keys<\/strong> or a bank account we recommend that you<strong> change the passwords <\/strong>or even delete them.  In addition, it is important if a false profile has been created that<strong> report it to the platform<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>#4 Collect all possible evidence about the scam<\/h3>\n<p>If it has not helped you to contact the scammer in question, you have to prepare to report.  Before reporting you should try to obtain all the evidence of the scam itself, it is possible that <strong>you must do it before a notary<\/strong> to draw up a record and it may be worth a screenshot of the computer or an electronic component where the action that has given rise to the scam is seen.  If you have made a purchase through a website, it is important that you keep proof of payment.<\/p>\n<p><i\/><\/p>\n<p>\t\t\tIf the scammer has sent you a product that has nothing to do with what you bought, the scam will be <strong>harder to justify<\/strong>.  In this case you must report to the police <strong>with the product<\/strong>which will be used as evidence at trial.\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n<h3>#5 Report fraud properly<\/h3>\n<p>The <strong>citizen collaboration <\/strong>It is vital to achieve the extinction of frauds, it is also important so that everyone can know the different frauds that exist and which are the most common to be able to identify them and not fall for them, so the frauds can be intercepted in time and you will avoid that others fall for the scam.

On the other hand, if you do it on Amazon and Ebay there is a policy in which <strong>the money will be returned to you immediately<\/strong> in case of possible fraud.  Therefore, in any case,<strong> communicate what happened<\/strong> to proceed to remove the scammer&#8217;s account and ads and prevent the same thing from happening to other people. <\/p>\n<p><i\/><\/p>\n<p>\t\t\tIf the seller is <strong>Foreign <\/strong>everything is complicated, since you would be before a <strong>international law case<\/strong> and agreements between countries, which <strong>stretch the times<\/strong> and the possibility of finding a solution.\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n<h3>#7 Go to the Municipal Consumer Information Organization<\/h3>\n<p>This is a step that you must do with any scam since it is an organization that <strong>inform, help and guide<\/strong> to customers.
