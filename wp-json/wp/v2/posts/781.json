What are the risks if I buy Bitcoins?<\/h2>\n<p>There are many questions that people have about Bitcoin, especially when it comes to security.<\/p>\n<p>When you get a <strong>Bitcoin <\/strong>after executing the P2P program, how do we know that it will not disappear from our wallet or wallet, <strong>as Coinbase<\/strong>?  It is said that behind its security there is a complex verification system to guarantee the reliability of this currency, so that it is not used maliciously and above all, to avoid inflation.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"seguro\">Bitcoin: safe or scam?<\/h2>\n<p>But still, <strong>how to be calm with the security of Bitcoin<\/strong>, Are they really safe or are they a scam?  To answer this question, in this post we are going to talk about the technology that ensures its validity.<\/p>\n<p>Before entering the subject, and for a better understanding, we must handle the following technical terms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hashed: <\/strong>In the computer field, it is any object or thing that can be represented in bits, it is a kind of digital fingerprint.  Its importance lies in the fact that <strong>has a unique ID <\/strong>and it cannot be changed, it does not vary in any way.  No two hashes can be the same.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Digital signature:<\/strong> Process that allows any person or interested party to verify the origin of an object.  Is he <strong>equivalent to a signature made in handwriting<\/strong>, is what distinguishes you and certifies that it is you who has generated, verified or received the object you own.  When a Bitcoin is generated, its original owner receives two keys, one public and one private, both of which are combined to verify the authenticity of the object.  This combination method is unique and extremely secure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Something very important that people who want or seek to use Bitcoin as a means of doing business should know is that <strong>this coin can only be used once<\/strong>since it is based on two basic aspects.<\/p>\n<p>First, <strong>transactions<\/strong>which, as is already known, <strong>it&#8217;s about sending money<\/strong>, in this case Bitcoin to another person or user;  the second, are <strong>the blocks<\/strong>, which are a group of transactions that keep a record of each operation or transaction that is carried out with Bitcoin, which also includes a time stamp, the verification number and the previous block, that is, what its origin is.  This <strong>ensures that the same user does not use the currency twice<\/strong>thus generating malicious activity with Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin, being a free currency, that is, without an entity that controls its emission, it is necessary to use the technique of mining or mining coins so that more coins enter the market.  The blocks are generated by the miners after verifying that a Bitcoin has not been spent.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bitcoins are stored in a wallet <\/strong>that is obtained when installing the software on the PC, and to carry out transactions from it, the use of the keys that are received when generating a Bitcoin is required and to verify its validity, it is essential to use the combination of the public ID and private to prove the authenticity of its origin.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, <strong>bitcoins are really safe<\/strong>because its security system is based on a complex system of combinations and long block chains, so you can rest easy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Is Bitcoin Safe?
