All you need to do is create a user, upload the content you want to convert to NFT, and connect your crypto wallet to pay for gas: the cost of uploading that file to the blockchain.  Here are 5 of the best platforms to get started in the world of NFTs.<\/p>\n<h2>Create, sell and buy NFTs<\/h2>\n<p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique assets that are used for the digital representation of a physical good or a digital asset on the blockchain.  Their main characteristic is that they are finite and unique and that they have been designed to be digitally verifiable.  These features make NFTs perfect for creating digital art, crypto collectibles and digital games with the ability to handle money natively and securely.<\/p>\n<p class=\"title single\">Solana Devs Earn Millions With NFTs Copied From Ethereum<\/p>\n<p>The only thing that is needed to start creating an NFT is a crypto wallet to pay for the cost of gas.  This cost will depend on the congestion of the network, that is, the volume of transactions that are being made in the blockchain at that moment.  Currently, the price of gas on the Ethereum blockchain exceeds $100, but some platforms such as Mintable or Hic et Nunc prevent us from having to pay anything to create our NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>When choosing a crypto wallet, we recommend having a software wallet like MetaMask.  The MetaMask crypto wallet can be downloaded as a mobile app or as a Chrome or Mozilla Firefox extension.  Once set up, the wallet will automatically connect to the platform you want to use and your NFTs will be stored securely.<\/p>\n<h4>Open Sea<\/h4>\n<p>OpenSea is the NFT platform par excellence.  It was created in 2018 and currently has more than 20 million NFTs within it.  In the last month, more than 2.29 million transactions were made with a total value of $3.66 billion.  As of today, it has almost 250,000 users, according to data from DappRadar.<\/p>\n<p>One of the main attractions of OpenSea is its ease of use.  Simply connect the wallet, upload the file you want to convert and give it a name.  Also, creating an NFT on OpenSea is completely free as it does not require any type of commission.  Of course, the platform charges 2.5% of the sale price if you manage to sell your NFT.<\/p>\n<p>FTX Launches NFT Platform on Ethereum and Solana Blockchains<\/p>\n<p>Also, when putting the NFT up for sale you have to pay the gas fee to upload it to the blockchain.  However, another feature of OpenSea is that you only have to pay this fee when publishing the first NFT in your collection.  In other words, if you are thinking of uploading several NFTs, you will only pay the gas fee for the first one.<\/p>\n<p>When putting the NFT up for sale, you can choose between putting a fixed price for direct sale or selling it by auction.  In auction, you will have to decide on a minimum price, an auction expiration date and a maximum price.  In addition, you can configure different rewards, so that if someone shares the NFT link and manages to sell it, they get a small percentage of the sale.  Once the NFT is sold, you will receive the money directly to the crypto wallet you have connected with.<\/p>\n<h4>rare<\/h4>\n<p>According to data from DappRadar, Rarible had a total sales volume of more than $19 million in the last month thanks to its nearly 10,000 users.  After OpenSea, it is one of the best-known NFT marketplaces.<\/p>\n<p>It has an interface very similar to that of OpenSea and also stands out for its easy operation.  You connect your portfolio, upload the file and put it up for sale.  Like OpenSea, Rarible charges a 2.5% fee every time a sale is made.  However, this platform also charges 2.5% to the buyer, so it charges a total of 5% in commissions for each sale.<\/p>\n<p>Also, unlike OpenSea, in Rarible you must pay the price of gas for each NFT you want to put up for sale and sellers have to provide the price of gas when the NFT is put up for auction and when it is sold.  This greatly increases the price of creating an NFT, considering that gas fees are currently over $100 on the Ethereum network.<\/p>\n<p>One advantage of Rarible over OpenSea is that it has its own token, the RARI.  Which can create incentives to use Rarible, since each time an NFT is bought and sold within the platform, tokens are received.  In fact, the price of the RARI has gone from a low of $1.30 at the beginning of the year to $20.10 today.<\/p>\n<h4>mintable<\/h4>\n<p>On the Mintable platform, there were 806 transactions in the last month with a total value of more than $51,000.  Although these numbers are far from the previous two platforms, Mintable has features that make it a very good option to start experimenting with NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>The process of creating an NFT is simple.  You just have to create a user, upload the file with a title and put it up for sale.  The main advantage of Mintable compared to the two previous marketplaces is that it is not necessary to pay any gas fee to upload an NFT.  When uploading an NFT, the platform gives us the option to create the NFT for free or upload it &#8220;normally&#8221; by paying the gas fee.  If we select the option of not paying the gas fee, the platform will keep 5% of the money we receive from the sale, while if we choose to pay the gas fee, the platform will keep 2.5%.<\/p>\n<p>Solana, the cryptocurrency whose value has skyrocketed thanks to NFTs<\/p>\n<p>Also, if we choose not to pay for gas, the NFT will not appear as created on other marketplaces until it is sold or transferred.  That is, the created NFT appears on the Mintable platform and is registered and available for purchase, but the NFT is not available in our crypto wallet.<\/p>\n<h4>super rare<\/h4>\n<p>In the last month, SuperRare had more than 3,500 transactions with a total value of more than $20 million.  Unlike the previous 3 platforms, SuperRare is not open to everyone, since it is focused on the world of art.<\/p>\n<p>SuperRare is an exclusive platform for artists.  Only single edition items that have been created by a single artist are sold. To publish in SuperRare you need to fill out a contact form in which the artist profile is granted and they only include a few profiles per month.<\/p>\n<p>When uploading the work, the artists must prove that it is original and that it has been created by them.  For this, a short presentation video must be provided, between 3 and 5 previous works and a story behind the work to be uploaded and the reason why it should be on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Ethereum DeFi and NFTs Remain Oblivious to Crypto Market Correction<\/p>\n<p>In addition, SuperRare has its own social network within the platform.  Users can follow, like and talk with NFT creators similar to the famous social network Instagram.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"h3 mb-0\">Hic et Nunc<\/h4>\n<p>The Hic et Nunc platform, &#8220;here and now&#8221; in Spanish, had almost 1.5 million transactions in the last month and moved more than $25 million.  Hic et Nunc was born as a response to platforms that use proof of work as a consensus mechanism.  An algorithm criticized for being highly polluting.  Therefore, unlike the previous 4 platforms that use the Ethereum blockchain, Hic et Nunc operates on the Tezos blockchain.  A blockchain that uses proof of participation as a consensus mechanism, a much less polluting algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>The platform is easy to use and has a minimalist design reminiscent of arcade machines.  Also, by using your own blockchain, the cost of creating an NFT is much lower than that of creating it on the Ethereum blockchain.  Currently, the cost per NFT on Hic et Nunc is less than $1, while on Ethereum it is more than $100.<\/p>\n<p>Another outstanding aspect of this platform is its community.  Respect for the environment has attracted many artists to this platform and has created a community made up of many artists who support each other.<\/p>\n<p><b>You can also follow us on our channels <\/b><b>Telegram <\/b><b>Y <\/b><b>Twitter<\/b><b>.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Image by MMT from Pixabay<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"screen-reader-text\">post navigation<\/h2>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Creating NFTs is almost as easy as uploading a photo to Facebook or Instagram and anyone with a crypto wallet can create, sell and buy an NFT on the various platforms available.
