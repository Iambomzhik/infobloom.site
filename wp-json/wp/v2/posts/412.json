Maybe it&#8217;s a trip or a prize, a lottery or a sweepstakes.  Your caller is so excited that he can&#8217;t wait to hand you your prize.<\/p>\n<p>But this is what happens next: they tell you that you have to pay a charge, some taxes or customs duties.  And then they ask for your credit card number or bank account information, or they ask you to make a money transfer.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, instead of winning something you lose your money.  And you never get that grand prize.  But what you do get are more requests for money and more promises saying you&#8217;ve earned something big.<\/p>\n<h3>This is what you can do:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Do not give your money \u2013 or your information \u2013 to anyone.<\/strong> Never give your financial information to someone who contacts you and says they need it.  And never wire money to someone who asks you to wire them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Give this information to a friend.<\/strong> You may dismiss these kinds of scams and hang up when you receive these calls.  But chances are you know someone who can take advantage of this information.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Please report scams.<\/h3>\n<p>If you know of a scam, please report it to the Federal Trade Commission.  Report a scam online or call the FTC at 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357) or TTY 1-866-653-4261.  Your complaint can help protect other people.  By filing a complaint, you can help FTC investigators identify imposters and stop them before they can extort someone else&#8217;s hard-earned money.  This really makes a difference.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You receive a card, a call or an email telling you that you won!
