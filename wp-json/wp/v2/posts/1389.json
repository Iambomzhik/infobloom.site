But Fauve Paris did not sit idly by, and finally, The Burnt Auction with 44 NFTS offered in public auction could take place. How? With a little trick.<\/p>\n<p>After getting around some legal problems, auctioning \u201cdigital\u201d works is not legal in the strict French auction code, the auction house Fauve Paris, carried out the first face-to-face auction of NFTs in France, thanks to the motivation of its director and founder, Lucie-Eleonore Riveron. The auction was held on March 10, 2022, and its name Burnt Auction (literally &#8220;burnt auction&#8221;) came from the undesirable situation that they found with the authorities: the obligation to auction something physical in French auctions. Lucie decided to get around the law by offering for each NFT &#8220;a paper printout of the NFT information.&#8221; In a symbolic act of rebellion against the ban, which delayed the sale for a few days, Lucie performed a performance burning the paper impressions, watch the video&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Going into the details of the sale and, according to a note provided by the management of Fauve Paris, 44 NFT works were offered, of which two thirds were sold.
