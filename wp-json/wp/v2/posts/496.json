A couple of weeks ago, the American artist <strong>Mike Winkelman<\/strong>known as <strong>beeple<\/strong>, sold an NFT of a digital collage, worth $69.3 million.  This record for a digital work seems to have aroused the interest of artists and investors in NFTs, since this instrument could transform the old and elitist art market.<\/p>\n<h3>What are non-fungible tokens?<\/h3>\n<p>In this case, a token is called a representation of a tangible asset stored in a blockchain, that is, an identifiable property stored in an unalterable public record.  This technology is based on &#8220;blocks&#8221; of encrypted data that are recorded in chronological order, guaranteeing the traceability of the asset or identifiable asset.  Without going into details about how they work, what you need to know is that NFTs are \u201cnon-fungible\u201d blockchains, that is, they are irreplaceable and indivisible representations of assets considered unique.<\/p>\n<p>If you still don&#8217;t understand what this technology has to do with art, don&#8217;t worry, its operating principle is simple.  NFTs allow the identification and possession of a unique digital work of art, whatever the type of work, guaranteeing that the buyer of the NFT is the owner of the \u201coriginal\u201d copy, even if the work is freely accessible on the internet.  It is exactly the same when you buy a copy of a famous painting, the copy could eventually be identical, however you do not own the original work of the artist, which is worth millions.<\/p>\n<p>Described in this way, NFTs do not appear to be revolutionary at all, and indeed the value of NFTs is based on the fictional rarity it creates.  Why fictional?  Why you could get an identical (really identical) copy of the same digital work for free, even if you do not have the only NFT that allows you to identify the uniqueness of the copy you own.  For example, I could download a copy of the work \u201cEverydays \u2014 The First 5000 Days\u201d, by the artist Beepel, but unlike the buyer who paid millions for his non-fungible token, I do not have an irreplaceable element that represents my ownership of it. construction site.<\/p>\n<p>This is not to say that investing in these tokens is not worth it.  NFTs are an innovative way of revaluing the work of contemporary artists in a context in which artistic creations shared on the internet do not allow them to finance their work.  Investing in an NFT allows you to support your favorite artists so they can keep producing.  Also, unlike donations, some NFTs give artists a percentage of the profit on each transaction, increasing their income based on the value the work acquires in the market over time.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that NFTs, like any other cryptocurrency, lend themselves to speculative bubbles.  Therefore, it is most likely that this technology will not change the dynamics of the international art market.  The future of NFTs is uncertain, even the energy consumption of the servers in which they are stored could become unsustainable, however, as has been the case for many other technologies, they may allow valuable new business models for contemporary artists. and investors.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a digital content creator, an investor or just someone who wants to help finance their favorite artists, know that you can create, buy and sell non-fungible tokens on sites like OpenSea, Rarible or Nifty Gateway.  Although these platforms allow you to create NFTs without prior technical knowledge about the blockchain, this technology has a cost that you will have to pay on any of these websites.  If what you want is to invest in NFTs, remember that the artists retain the copyright, what you would be buying is a digital certificate of inimitable, verifiable and collectible property.<\/p>\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">This article represents the judgment of the person signing it.
