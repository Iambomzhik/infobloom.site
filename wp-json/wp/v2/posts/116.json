For this, it is necessary to approach some concepts to understand this market and if it really represents an investment opportunity or if NFTs are a scam, because as in any asset you have to have a <b>extreme care<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>To understand the NFT market, you have to go term by term.  First, understand the definition, <strong>his <\/strong><b>functioning<\/b> and what have been the main drawbacks that have surrounded the phenomenon in recent times.  Especially, in order to avoid any stop along the way that may occur.<\/p>\n<h2>What are NFTs?  Approach to the concept<\/h2>\n<p>Many people wonder how to make money with NFTs, but, as always, you have to build the house from the ground up.  What is an NFT, then?  Well, these acronyms translate to <b>Non-Fungible Token<\/b>or a non-fungible token.<\/p>\n<p>Tokens are units of value that are assigned to a business model, such as cryptocurrencies.  In this sense, NFTs have a close relationship with crypto assets, at least on a technological level.  An <b>Bitcoin<\/b>, for example, is a fungible asset, while an NFT is not.  These are the two basic aspects within this field of technology.<\/p>\n<p>Going deeper into the term, we can think of cryptocurrencies as a store of value, something <b>resembling gold<\/b>.  You can buy and sell gold, and when the number of buyers increases the price goes up, to go down when this number of buyers decreases.  It is a behavior equal to that of cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>However the <b>NFT market <\/b>differs from this.  There are other goods made of gold that also have a value, but they are unique, and that fact makes the difference and gives them another type of value.<\/p>\n<p>Like that security made from the gold metal or a work of art, NFTs are unique assets that<strong> cannot be modified or exchanged <\/strong>by another that has the same value, since there are no two NFTs that are equivalent in the same way that there are no two tables that are.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, you can think of an NFT as a large <b>artwork<\/b>Like Da Vinci&#8217;s Mona Lisa.  There is only one and it is in a specific art gallery.  If you want it, you can only buy the original if it was for sale.  You could also get a copy, but it would have another value, since it would not be the original.  Well, that&#8217;s exactly what the NFT does, but <b>digital form<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, the NFT market would encompass unique works of art, such as the Mona Lisa.  Of these products you can only find one, as you can only see said painting in the Louvre museum in Paris.  That gives you a <b>unique value<\/b> and that is why many investors want to know how to make money with NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, NFTs are usually attached to some works or <b>digital artwork<\/b>.  Its price is actually the one that people mark them.  Like a stock listed on the markets, it goes in relation to supply and demand.  If it is a unique good and there is a demand, therefore, the price will be higher.<\/p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube-nocookie.com\/embed\/IATL1oJcZ0k\" tabindex=\"-1\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>How NFTs work: the application of these assets<\/h2>\n<p>Going deeper into what an NFT is, we must focus on its operation.  These work by <strong>block chain<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It is the same technology as cryptocurrencies, which operate thanks to a decentralized computer network, with linked and insured blocks or nodes. <b>using crypto<\/b>.  Each block links to a previous block, as well as date and transaction data, and is by design resistant to data modification.<\/p>\n<p>The NFT market therefore has an allocation that is a kind of <b>digital certificate of authenticity<\/b>.  That is, metadata that will not be able to be modified.  With them, their authenticity is guaranteed, the starting value and all the acquisitions or transactions that have been made are recorded, as well as their author.<\/p>\n<p>The translation of all this is that, if you buy a <b>tokenized digital content<\/b> with NFT, at all times there will always be proof of the first value it had, and how much you bought it for.  It is exactly the same as when you buy a painting in an art gallery.  There is a record that indicates where that product moves.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, the NFT market is based on network standards <b>ethereum<\/b> and its blockchain.  Hand in hand with this well-known and highly popular technology, it is relatively easy to operate with them to buy and sell them, with the use of wallets that work with the Ether network.<\/p>\n<h2>Are NFTs a scam?<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have understood how NFTs work, it is interesting to focus on the frauds that are related to these tokens.  As with other products, there are also <b>scams that are tied to these assets<\/b>.  In this way, the important thing is to identify them and know how to act accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>The <b>crypto art<\/b> he is no stranger to scams.  \u201cPainting the tape\u201d is a strategy where fraudsters seek to drive up the price of an asset and then sell it at an inflated price.  Beware of this type of fraud that seeks to take advantage of novice investors.<\/p>\n<p>According to Investopedia: \u201c&#8217;<b>Paint the tape<\/b><strong>  is a type of market manipulation<\/strong> whereby market participants attempt to influence the price of a security by buying and selling it among themselves to create the appearance of substantial trading activity.<\/p>\n<p>The goal is to create the illusion of increased interest in a stock in order to mislead investors into buying shares,<strong> what would make the price go up<\/strong>\u201d.  That is a very simple thing to do in the NFT market.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you launch such a token and sell it to yourself for \u20ac5 and then buy it back again with a different ETH address for \u20ac2,000.  You buy it back for 20,000 euros from another ETH address and, finally, you sell it to another person for 5,000 euros.  This will make buyers think the price is a bargain,<strong> but it is actually a scam.<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Analysis of 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs shows that the top 10% of traders have traded 97% of NFTs which definitely puts meat on the bones of the hypothesis that a lot of NFT trades are washing sales intended to artificially boost prices.  https:\/\/t.co\/ufgmhE2iBi<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Dare Obasanjo (@Carnage4Life) November 30, 2021<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>How can you avoid <b>NFT scams<\/b>?
