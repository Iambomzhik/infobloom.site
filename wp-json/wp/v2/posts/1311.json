In his post, his followers have been advised not to mint new tokens, click on any links, or link their wallet to anything.<\/p>\n<p class=\"default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 hGyCGD body-paragraph\">The attacker has used the &#8216;phishing&#8217; technique to, after hacking access to the Bored Ape Yacht Club account on Instagram, publish an ad about a fake &#8216;Airdrop&#8217;, a technique whereby companies send newly minted tokens for free to enhance their commitment to a cause.<\/p>\n<p class=\"default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 hGyCGD body-paragraph\">This &#8216;Airdrop&#8217; in question promised access to an upcoming Bored Ape project, for which it asked users to connect their MetaMask wallets. Once done, the site has stolen your digital assets, which have been ultimately transferred to the attacker&#8217;s wallet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 hGyCGD body-paragraph\">The attacker&#8217;s account, which has already been identified, has amassed a total of 91 NFT, of which only some were from Bored Ape, according to specialized media The Block. Zerion, a DeFi aggregator for cryptocurrency investors, estimates the total value of the stolen NFTs to be $2.8 million (\u20ac2.6 million at current exchange rates) based on the minimum price of the respective collections.<\/p>\n<p class=\"default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 hGyCGD body-paragraph\">The co-founder of Bored Ape, Garga, has stated on Twitter that the firm will be in contact with its affected users and has defended that the Instagram account &#8220;followed best practices&#8221; and had two-step authentication enabled.<\/p>\n<p class=\"default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 hGyCGD body-paragraph\">Garga has also clarified that, despite information published in some media, only 10 NFTs have been stolen from his collection. However, the value of each of them is six figures. The Verge recalls that four of the stolen NFTs have been sold in recent months for an amount of Ethereum that, at the current exchange rate, is more than one million dollars (900,000 euros).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Instagram account of Bored Ape Yacht Club, a community of non-fungible tokens (NFT) owned by Yuga Labs, has been the victim of a cyber attack that has resulted in the theft of several assets valued at 2.8 million dollars (2, 6 million euros at the current exchange rate).
