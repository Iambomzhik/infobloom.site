Fake social media notifications<\/h2>\n<p>Scammers often send fake notifications that appear to come from social media about new friends, their activity, comments, likes, and more.  These types of messages are identical to the real ones, the only difference is that they have a <strong>phishing link<\/strong>, which is not always easy to detect.  In that link, users are encouraged to enter their username and password on a fake login page.<\/p>\n<p>These messages are also used as fake threat alerts, to announce that suspicious activity has been detected in your account or that a new feature has been introduced and users who do not consent will be blocked.  Either way, the message will contain a button with a link to a phishing login page.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-17523\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The most popular tricks of scammers: Fake notifications from social networks<\/p>\n<h2>2. Phishing in banks<\/h2>\n<p>Phishing that seeks users&#8217; bank card information remains the type of <strong>online fraud<\/strong> more popular.  These fake messages can be sent on behalf of banks or payment systems reporting a possible account lockout or \u201csuspicious activity\u201d in the customer&#8217;s personal account.<\/p>\n<p>Under the guise of restoring access, confirming identity or canceling a transaction, the user is asked to enter their banking information (often with the CVV\/CVC code) on a fake banking website.  After receiving the data, the criminals immediately withdraw the money from the victim&#8217;s account.  The same happens with payment systems, but in these cases, users are only required to log in to their accounts.<\/p>\n<p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-17524\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-17524 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653555856_144_Online-fraud-the-5-most-common-methods-of-scammers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1002\" height=\"904\"\/><\/p>\n<p id=\"caption-attachment-17524\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The most popular tricks of scammers: fake notifications from banks and payment systems<\/p>\n<h2>3.
