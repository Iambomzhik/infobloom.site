This type of system is unsustainable, of course, and when a bunch of node operators decide to dump their leftover coins, the market crashes.<\/p>\n<p>Despite these inherent weaknesses, the concept of masternodes remains strong: it&#8217;s just that for the system to work, the network must be worth protecting in the first place, and for that to happen, the currency must be used for more than just staking. \u2013 such as remittances, P2P payments or e-commerce.  As a result, it makes more sense for developers to focus on generating demand for a blockchain first, rather than launching masternodes and hoping the utility will follow.<\/p>\n<p>Newer projects like Origin Protocol, Dadi, Essentia, REMME, and Zencash will add masternodes in the future.  The difference, with these networks, is that the nodes will be a feature rather than the defining one.  The next generation of masternode coins could actually be worth something.
