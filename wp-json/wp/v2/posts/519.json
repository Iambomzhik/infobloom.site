She heard a man passing by on the street offering his services as an electrical appliance technician. She looked out on the balcony and made him go up to the apartment.<\/p>\n<p>The man checked the equipment and told him that the problem was a damaged piece that cost RD$400.00 and that he could go buy it himself at the hardware store.  Confident, she gave him the money and the man left a sack that she assumed were her tools.
