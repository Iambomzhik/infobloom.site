In this article you will learn what NFTs are, what their potential is and which are the 10 best-selling NTFs in the context of digital art.<\/p>\n<h2>NFTs and digital art: top 10 sellers<\/h2>\n<h2 id=\"h-que-son-los-nfts\">What are NFTs?<\/h2>\n<p>NFTs are certificates of ownership and authenticity of physical and digital goods.  The acronym NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, which translates as non-fungible token.  NFTs are tokenized assets that are created through smart contracts, assigning ownership to a single owner. <\/p>\n<p>This ownership feature is handled through a unique ID that cannot be replicated.  When an NFT is created, a code stored in a smart contract that conforms to the standards of each blockchain is executed.  The main characteristics of NFTs is that they are unique, indivisible and transferable.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h-explosion-de-los-nfts\">NFT explosion<\/h2>\n<p>The rise of NFTs emerged in 2021, after the radical change in human behavior due to the pandemic.  Many people spent more time glued to the internet and to screens and, as a result, digital life took power and is now more valued than in previous years.  Cryptocurrencies and NFTs exploded as many more people explored these new digital goods.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h-bloques-fundamentales-de-la-web-3-0\">Fundamental blocks of Web 3.0 <\/h2>\n<p>Many layer 1 blockchains deployed their projects between the years 2019 and 2020 focusing on creating an infrastructure for decentralized finance.  Due to this, 2020 saw a boom in the DeFi market based on the new infrastructure of these blockchains. <\/p>\n<p>This boom stemmed from the success of Ethereum and its smart contract ecosystem.  Many developers saw the potential of decentralized finance and this led to a consolidation of many platforms such as Uniswap, MakerDao, and Aave.<\/p>\n<p>This led to a growth in NFTs as new digital goods, as they not only have the potential to establish ownership of digital goods but physical goods as well.  From the growth of DeFi, new safe and accessible markets were created for users.  NFTs give way to data ownership that moves towards users and does not get stuck in centralized companies. <\/p>\n<p>In Web 3.0, cryptocurrencies and NFTs are the digital goods of this new economy, layer 1 blockchains are the ecosystems that feed it, DeFi is the new financial system, and DAOs are the institutions that govern the entire ecosystem. <\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h-aplicaciones-diversas\">various applications<\/h2>\n<p>NFTs can have applications from collectible items, lottery tickets, concert seats, digital art, real estate (both physical and digital), video game objects, credentials, internet domains, and any digital or physical good. <\/p>\n<p>2021 saw a massive increase in NFT trading volume exceeding $23 billion.  For now, the applications of NFTs are concentrated in digital art and blockchain games.  However, 2022 will bring with it new Web 3.0 platforms with NFTs as protagonists. <\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h-por-que-tuvieron-tal-crecimiento-en-2021\">Why did they have such growth in 2021?<\/h2>\n<p>NFTs had a monumental growth in 2021 due to the fact that the different blockchains were consolidated as more reliable, efficient and secure investment instruments for users.  As there was more trust in this new technology, a wider public accessed the platforms where NFTs were transacted. <\/p>\n<h3 id=\"h-crecimiento-a-la-par-de-las-criptomonedas\">Growth on a par with cryptocurrencies<\/h3>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies and NFTs ceased to be digital goods that only experts, computer scientists and crypto enthusiasts had access to and entered the mainstream world. <\/p>\n<p>With reliable and secure platforms, NFTs could be adopted and used in transactions by anyone on platforms like OpenSea and Rarible. <\/p>\n<p>Looking at the huge growth of cryptocurrencies, many people believed that they had missed out on investing, but found new possibilities in NFTs. <\/p>\n<h3 id=\"h-se-abrieron-camino-en-el-arte-digital\">They made their way into digital art<\/h3>\n<p>Seeing a new life in NFTs and their great growth in the different networks, many collections of NFTs were displayed as digital art. <\/p>\n<p>Accompanied by massive hype from artists like Beeple, Snoop Dogg, Grimes, Paris Hilton, Eminem, Jimmy Fallon, Logan Paul, and companies like Visa, NFTs grew unprecedentedly in 2021.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"h-de-la-mano-con-la-web-3-0\">Hand in hand with Web 3.0<\/h3>\n<p>The Web 3.0 discourse was born at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, but the concept remained only among experts on the subject.  A new Web 3.0 discourse emerged in 2021 and took NFTs as one of the fundamental blocks of this new internet revolution. <\/p>\n<p>Investors like Chris Dixon and Naval Ravikant back Web 3.0 and include NFTs as the pieces of property needed to build this new Web.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"h-los-10-nfts-mejor-vendidos\">Top 10 best selling NFTs<\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"h-1-merge\">1.
