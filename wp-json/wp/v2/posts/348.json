This cybercrime technique, which places Spain in second place among affected countries, is being used to steal virtual wallets and NFTs, in the same way that it is used to access bank accounts.  In this new trend, it is estimated that one of the great blockchain platforms, OpenSea, <strong>would have lost 200 million dollars in an attack<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_2\">This cryptographic market has opened an investigation after the panic suffered last Saturday 19, when more than <strong>two dozen users were left without access to their tokens<\/strong> most valuable digital  It is the second major theft of NFTs suffered by the platform this year, the first time due to a system failure.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_3\">In the name of OpenSea and appealing to a new type of digital contract without taxes, cybercriminals would have managed to convince a good number of users to expose their tokens whose value would exceed one million dollars.  The company is investigating what happened, but<strong> they still don&#8217;t know where the attack originated<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"content__summary-title\">The email<\/h3>\n<p id=\"paragraph_4\">&#8220;You can migrate your Ethereum listing to a new smart contract today, free of gas&#8221;, this is the message circulating on social networks as the person responsible for fishing the victims.  The email, in the name of OpenSea, urges users to migrate their virtual properties to this new tax-free contract before February 25. <\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">BREAKING: Over $200,000,000 worth of NFTs have been stolen from OpenSea via an email phishing hack.  pic.twitter.com\/nBplXiO4gt<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Plugged Inn (@pluggedinn) February 20, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"paragraph_5\">When cybercriminals refer to a free gas contract, they refer to the procedure known as &#8220;gas rate&#8221;.  This fee must be paid each time the price of a work or token is changed, a cost that users have tried on other occasions to avoid paying and also went wrong,<strong> facilitating theft and losing a lot of money<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_6\">Tempted by this new free contract, users would have accessed the indications of that false email, although it is still not clear.  Of the 32 accounts attacked <strong>254 tokens were obtained<\/strong>, according to a spreadsheet from blockchain security service PeckShield.  Among the stolen NFTs are Bored Monkey Yacht Club tokens and Azuki collections.  The creator of Web3, set the value of the stolen NFTs at 1.7 million dollars on Saturday 19, although other sources go up to 200 million dollars.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"content__summary-title\">They signed a blank contract<\/h3>\n<p id=\"paragraph_7\">The platform has opened an investigation to analyze how the attack occurred.  For now, they only know that<strong> the scam originated outside of your website<\/strong>.  Devin Fizer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, says &#8220;we are not aware of any of the affected users receiving or clicking on links in suspicious emails.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Another update: over the last few hours we&#8217;ve talked to dozens of people, teams, and projects across the NFT space.  https:\/\/t.co\/fB5r3cMA1r<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Devin Finzer (dfinzer.eth) (@dfinzer) February 20, 2022<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"paragraph_8\">According to The Verge, the attack appears to have exploited a vulnerability in the Wyvern Protocol, the open source standard underlying most NFT smart contracts.  Usually, <strong>the victims would have ended up signing a blank contract<\/strong> and, once signed, the attackers completed the rest of the contract to take their tokens.<\/p>\n<p id=\"paragraph_9\">This theft comes just as the company had announced a new smart contract and was asking people to migrate their assets.  OpenSea assures that the attack did not originate on its website and that it is not related to its new contracts.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"content__summary-title\">You may also like&#8230;<\/h3>\n<ul class=\"content__summary-list content__summary-list--bullets\">\n<li class=\"summary-list__item\">The DGT phishing alert: an unpaid fine, the hook of hackers<\/li>\n<li class=\"summary-list__item\">They discover the most advanced phishing in history: &#8220;It is a weapon against which there is no defense&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"follow-topics-title\">Follow the topics that interest you<\/h3>\n<p>            <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Related news Phishing attacks also affect new digital markets such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs.
