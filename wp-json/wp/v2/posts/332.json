However, one of the first cases arose when the<strong> Christie&#8217;s auction house<\/strong> put a completely digital work up for sale for a whopping 58.6 million euros.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m194-193-195\">The rush for NFTs is such that the <strong>Elon Musk <\/strong>It was also launched to create a song mocking these tokens and a buyer was about to acquire it for one million euros.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m199-198-200\">Now him <strong>Spanish YouTuber Willyrex<\/strong> has announced that it is preparing a collection of five NFTs together with the illustrator and digital artist Zigor Samaniego.  As he detailed on his Instagram there will be few units available, they will go on sale for 24 hours and prices will range from one to 1,000 euros.<\/p>\n<p>            <\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m236-235-237\">NFT literally means in English &#8216;<strong>Non-fungible token<\/strong>&#8216;, that is, a type of cryptographic token that cannot be copied.  That is why many people are starting to pay large amounts for exclusive digital products.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"m241-240-242\">What is an NFT?<\/h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m246-245-247\">As we have said before, they are non-fungible tokens or currencies.  Which means they are <strong>crypto assets based on <\/strong>blockchain that cannot be copied because they are made up of unique identification codes and metadata that allow them to be distinguished from each other.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m251-250-252\">Therefore, each of the NFTs has great <strong>exclusiveness<\/strong> and they can be from a digital work like the Beeple collage that Christie&#8217;s sold to audio files, video, memes, gifs or tweets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m256-255-257\">What gets the <strong>blockchain technology<\/strong>, which is also found in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, is to provide trust and traceability to works because transactions can be recorded.  However, in this case they are not interchangeable with another file of the same value or divisible into small parts.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m261-260-262\">Each NFT has a <strong>own characteristics<\/strong> that include information about the file or its ownership, although they are not actually physical objects that we can touch. <\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udca3\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5 I&#8217;ve been preparing my own NFTs for weeks, yesterday I promised to show you a part that we have advanced&#8230; soon you will know more \ud83d\ude08 pic.twitter.com\/FrjBMw0AXt<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Willyrex (@WillyrexYT) March 22, 2021<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"m271-270-272\">Up for auction for millions<\/h2>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m276-275-277\">These <strong>crypto collectibles <\/strong>They are nothing more than digital files verified for their originality that have become collector&#8217;s items even if you can&#8217;t have them hanging in your living room.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m281-280-282\">The current world revolution makes these <strong>NFT can be infinite<\/strong>for example, they can be used to create unique weapons or skins for certain video games or acquire online licenses, digital art and many others.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m286-285-287\">What most interests users is that<strong> exclusivity factor<\/strong>And once you buy it, it will be yours alone because it will be linked to your online identity.  Plus, it&#8217;s impossible to forge or copy thanks to embedded metadata, so you can always verify its authenticity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m291-290-292\">Actually NFTs are not new, <strong>exist since 2012<\/strong> and one of the most notorious cases was Cryptokitties, a video game built on Ethereum that allows you to raise virtual pets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"paragraph \" id=\"m296-295-297\">Although at the moment there is a long way to go to see the maximum potential of this technology, little by little it is being introduced on digital platforms and it may be more and more common to hear about <strong>auctions of digital works<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>jack dorsey, the founder of Twitter, has sold the first tweet in history as an NFT for a total of 2.9 million dollars.
