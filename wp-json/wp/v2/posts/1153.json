Thanks to this new form of market, artists can sell their works and fans become the sole owners of pieces that are impossible to replicate.<\/p>\n<p>To talk about NFTs it is important to mention the term Blockchain. This technology is very interesting because it connects directly with a fascinating information chain, this term can be understood as a public network that maintains transaction records and allows money to be exchanged while keeping information secure through cryptographic algorithms. Many technologies are based on this idea of \u200b\u200bdecentralization that we do not stop hearing today, such as: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Cryptocurrencies, NFT, smart contracts, among others.<\/p>\n<p>The Blockchain is a decentralized database, to check the transactions of each asset. Which implies, checking with many computers the ownership of something, in this case of NFT or Crypto Art.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is an NFT?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Better known as Non-Fungible Token, it is a type of digital asset, unique, that is not physical and cannot be modified. It can be an image, a gif, a painting, a video, a photograph, or a collectible item from a video game.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is an Ethereum? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is a digital platform that adopts blockchain technology and expands its use to a wide variety of applications. Ether, its native cryptocurrency, is the second largest on the market. Although Bitcoin is the most valuable currency, Ethereum is used to carry out transactions on decentralized websites, in this case for purchases of NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>For some time now, with the first NFTs, it was possible to make digital works of art that were achieved with Blockchain technology to be able to certify the ownership of a digital asset. And for many copies that can be made, this registered digital asset will only appear with the name of the owner of the file who will be able to sell it to other people, its value over time can increase considerably, although sometimes this may not happen and the NFT will end for losing its value in the market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beginning of NFTs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To talk about Non-Fungible Tokens, it is important to mention the game CryptoKitties (2017), built on the Ethereum blockchain that has gone viral since its launch and is perhaps one of the first NFTs in history. This game consisted of buying, collecting, exchanging and selling cats in virtual formats, once you start the game you can breed them and get new ones. Since its launch this buying and selling has caused amazing growth.<\/p>\n<p>CryptoKitty sold for 600 ETH \u2013<\/p>\n<p>Another project of non-fungible tokens are the Cryptopunks that came out in 2017, these 2D avatars of 24\u00d724 pixels and 8 bits tokenized in the Ethereum blockchain, are based on the punk aesthetic of the 70s, since that component was wanted to be transmitted revolutionary of the blockchain, they were born for free and are now worth millions. Being one of the first NFTs they are highly valued by collectors and that is why their price is too high.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-1758\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653542161_676_NFTs-and-Crypto-Art-\u2013-Kichi-Japanese-Cafe.png\" alt=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1758\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/kichicafejapones.com\/f24844_b670db1fc0fd49db8753fdc601e913e4_mv2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/koricafejapones.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/04\/f24844_b670db1fc0fd49db8753fdc601e913e4_mv2.png\" data-orig-size=\"337,270\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"f24844_b670db1fc0fd49db8753fdc601e913e4_mv2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/koricafejapones.files.wordpress.com\/2022\/04\/f24844_b670db1fc0fd49db8753fdc601e913e4_mv2.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653542161_676_NFTs-and-Crypto-Art-\u2013-Kichi-Japanese-Cafe.png\" data-id=\"1758\" \/><strong>Cryptopunks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the year 2021 one of the most popular cases was that of Logan Paul, the popular YouTube star who launches his own non-fungible tokens, NFTs.
