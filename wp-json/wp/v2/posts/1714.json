However, the popularity of these did not really skyrocket until March 2021, when various famous artists, musicians, and athletes began creating and selling NFTs tied to works they had made or customized.

How to invest in them?  And should we consider them as a good long-term investment?<\/p>\n<h2><strong>TL;  DR: What are non-fungible tokens or NFTs?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Non-fungible tokens are unique blockchain-based \u201ccurrencies\u201d.  No two tokens are the same and therefore they are not interchangeable.  these tokens <strong>are usually associated with pieces of creative content<\/strong>.  However, they do not necessarily represent intellectual property.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs have received their fair share of criticism.  Many in the art community are concerned about the carbon footprint of non-fungible tokens from the Ethereum 1.0 blockchain technology.  Others have pointed to the lack of fraud protection in this space.  Some experts even suggested that NFTs could fuel the problem of money laundering in the art world.<\/p>\n<p>However, advocates of non-fungible tokens have said that<strong> technology could act as the basis for a more stable and functional creative economy. <\/strong>Because NFTs can be programmed to pay royalties to their creators each time they exchange hands, they can provide a regular source of income for their creators.  Also, because NFTs do not always represent intellectual property, they offer a more flexible model for sales and creative property.<\/p>\n<p>Some have also programmed NFTs for use in various fields beyond art, music, and sports.  Real estate can be linked to non-fungible tokens. <strong>NFTs can be used to sell tickets for live events<\/strong>unique digital objects in video games and much more.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Are NFTs a good long-term investment?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>While non-fungible tokens may be extremely popular right now, <strong>it is not known how long this popularity will last<\/strong>, or whether NFTs will be a good long-term investment.  Many analysts agree that the NFT market is almost purely speculative at the moment.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1656501735_357_Guide-to-buying-and-investing-in-NFTs-safely.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Therefore, it is advisable <strong>treat NFTs as if they were any other type of investment<\/strong>.  Don&#8217;t invest more than you can afford to lose.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/1656501736_560_Guide-to-buying-and-investing-in-NFTs-safely.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/p>\n<p>However, in some cases, NFTs can be purchased as a way for fans to build relationships with creators they admire.  For example, 3LAU sold an NFT that included the creation of a custom song for its buyer;  Rob Gronkowski sold an NFT that offered the buyer VIP tickets to his next beach party.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other non-fungible tokens offer their holders the opportunity to participate in how a piece of digital art or music is presented. <\/strong>For example, NFTs linked to \u201cBetty&#8217;s Notebook,\u201d a programmable piece of music by the Verdigris Ensemble, allow its holder to manipulate certain elements of the piece.<\/p>\n<p><img width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"infographic how to invest ntfs non fungible tokens\"  src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Guide-to-buying-and-investing-in-NFTs-safely.jpg\" data- class=\"wp-image-29087 lazyload\"\/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to invest in NFT: what you need to know<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve chosen a piece of digital art or music, a digital trading card, or another type of digital collectible, the next step is to purchase it.  Pretty simple, right?  yes, but <strong>Buying an NFT is not always as simple as buying a \u201creal world\u201d collectible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The methodology for purchasing a non-fungible token depends on the NFT market in which you will make your purchase.  Some NFT markets may allow investors to purchase their tokens with credit cards;  others will require you to use crypto directly.<\/p>\n<p>In the latter case, the type of cryptocurrency you will need to make the purchase will depend on the blockchain on which the NFT was created.<\/p>\n<p>For example, markets<strong> OpenSea.io and Nifty Gateway <\/strong>they only sell non-fungible tokens that have been minted on the Ethereum blockchain.  Therefore, to buy NFTs on these platforms, you will need to use an Ether token.  Similarly, other platforms may offer sales in BNB, ADA, DOT, or native tokens belonging to other smart contract-enabled networks.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Storage of non-fungible tokens<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Safely storing NFTs is vital to protecting the investment in the long term.  Some NFT platforms offer their users the option to keep their tokens on the platform.  However, there have been several examples of account takeovers within the platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, <strong>NFT holders should consider having a digital wallet <\/strong>(wallet) of safer self-custody.  Depending on the blockchain your NFTs are minted on, you will need a different type of digital wallet.  Some NFT markets have integrated with crypto wallets that have browser extensions, such as MetaMask.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever a crypto wallet is created, make sure the password is visible to you and you alone.  You should create wallets only with trusted providers.  Make sure the site you are using to generate your digital wallet is not a phishing scam.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>NFT stocks to invest<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Investing directly in a non-fungible token can be risky.  If you are not comfortable with such a high level of risk, you might consider investing in stocks related to the NFT market.<\/p>\n<p>Even with NFT shares, however, <strong>there is a variable level of risk.<\/strong> Each level of risk depends on the business model of the company issuing the shares.  For example, does the company offer a platform that people can use to create NFTs?  Or are they issuing NFTs themselves?  Or something else?<\/p>\n<p>When considering whether or not to invest in an NFT stock, be sure to keep the following in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long is the company in operation?  What is the annual rate of growth of the firm&#8217;s investment earnings?<\/li>\n<li>How volatile has the stock price been in the past?  What is the price\/earnings ratio (P\/E)?  What is the price\/book value (P\/CV) ratio?<\/li>\n<li>What is the business model of the company?  In other words, how does the company plan to make a profit?<\/li>\n<li>Does the company have any competitive advantage?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are considering buying an NFT and need some Ether (ETH) tokens to get started, Coinmotion has you covered.
