This time, he has given one of lime and one of sand.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt that technology is interesting. That in 20 or 30 years it will stabilize in something beyond pure speculation because I can buy it from you,&#8221; he began by admitting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Now then, what <strong>someone who passively generates hundreds or thousands of euros a day told them about the benefits of something as volatile and dangerous as this to an audience as exposed and as massive as the one you have<\/strong>It makes me want not to vomit, but to vomit in your face.  But that&#8217;s my opinion,&#8221; Felipez concluded, citing Willyrex&#8217;s own tweet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Along the same lines was Yuste, the Twitch morning man par excellence: &#8220;NFTs are not a scam. The way you offer it to your audience is only<\/strong>.  The idea of \u200b\u200bclearly identifying the owner of a digital work or object is interesting and not a scam.  The &#8216;BUY NFTS DON&#8217;T BE A FOOL YOU WILL GET A LOT OF PROFITABILITY YOU WILL BE RICH 100% REAL DO NOT FAKE IF YOU BUY MY NFT&#8217;s is a scam&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ue-c-article__subheadline\">Alexelcapo: &#8220;All the incredible benefits they say they have are only focused on making money&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Alexelcapo has also wanted to go public to answer the controversy of Willyrex and cryptocurrencies, assuming that &#8220;the problem is not the NFT concept&#8221;<\/strong>.  &#8220;The problem is that of all the incredible benefits that they say they have, they only focus on one, making money. And yes, 99% of games (100% at the moment) are fucking shit, but they upload them anyway because you come here to make money&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ue-c-article__subheadline\">Eric Lostie pulls newspaper library to comment on NFTs<\/h2>\n<p>Streamers have come out of all the communities to answer Willyrex, with the most varied opinions.  Eric Lostie, creator of Pok\u00e9mon fan-games, has used the Spanish streamer&#8217;s own words against him: <strong>&#8220;I tried to inform myself with your own videos and when you said &#8216;downloading an NFT image is like taking a picture in front of a house and saying it&#8217;s yours&#8217;, I decided that I would never stop finding this ridiculous&#8221;<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"ue-c-article__subheadline\">Memes everywhere about Willyrex NFTs<\/h2>\n<p>There are always consequences.  And more when in the eye of the hurricane is a high-caliber youtuber.  Willyrex is and therefore the queue of the NFTs topic will be long and constant. <strong>The controversy has attracted a tweeting public that is always on the alert, basing its content on &#8216;shitposting&#8217;<\/strong>.
