What should you do next?<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve fallen for an Instagram scam, or think you may be a victim, you need to take steps to reduce the damage.<\/p>\n<p>This is because the personal information you have provided could be used to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>steal your identity<\/li>\n<li>Empty your bank accounts<\/li>\n<li>Violate any of your online accounts<\/li>\n<li>ruin your credit<\/li>\n<li>Spread malware to people you know<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Armed with this information, you can act quickly to put the hacker out of your life for the long haul. You should also be able to undo some or all of the immediate problems they have caused you.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips for taking action:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Check your bank accounts and credit cards.<\/strong>Search all your bank activity and statements for anything you don&#8217;t remember doing. A scammer who has your financial information can make transfers or purchases from your accounts. Don&#8217;t just look for big purchases, cybercriminals can reduce your expenses with small splurges. On occasion, purchases of as little as a few pesos have been discovered. If you have discovered something strange, report it to your bank or credit institution to stop any further use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Change your passwords.<\/strong> Obviously, you&#8217;ll want to change your Instagram password to be safe. But you may have compromised other accounts if you used a fake login form. If you&#8217;ve ever reused passwords and usernames, a scammer can break into more of your accounts. Be sure to change passwords in all essential places, like online banking, social media, email, and anywhere you pay bills or shop online.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use unique passwords for each online account.<\/strong> In addition to changing your passwords, make sure each one is complex and different. If it&#8217;s easy for you to remember, it can be easy for a hacker to guess. Passphrases with multiple character types will help keep you secure. Random character strings are the best option. To remember all these new passwords, use an online repository like Kaspersky Password Manager.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Check your credit and freeze it.<\/strong> Scammers have been known to set up new bank accounts and incur all kinds of debt in your name. If your identity has been stolen, it&#8217;s wise to check your credit score and report at three of the major institutions that offer these services. Experion, Equifax, and TransUnion collect information differently, so you&#8217;ll want to check all of them. Freezing your credit is another vital step in limiting problems caused by known identity theft.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use an identity theft verification service.<\/strong> Services like these will monitor any suspicious activity on your credit, tax returns, investments, and more. To keep an eye out for any further data breaches, Kaspersky Security Cloud offers constant monitoring and tips to protect you.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"width: 650px; height: auto; padding: .5em 0 .5em 0;\" title=\"How hackers can scam you on Instagram\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1652867181_833_Instagram-Scams-How-to-Stay-Safe.jpg\" alt=\"How hackers can scam you on Instagram\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>How to protect yourself against scams on Instagram<\/h2>\n<p>It seems that phishing on Instagram is here to stay, so you have to be prepared. Here are some reliable ways to detect and avoid becoming a victim of fraud.<\/p>\n<h3>The best ways to avoid Instagram fraud<\/h3>\n<p><strong>If a message asks you to \u201cgive\u201d something, be careful.<\/strong> Fraud often involves bank accounts, the sale of something, or the request for other personal information. This could include entering an account or being asked to make a payment for something. If you have received any direct messages or emails that seem suspicious to you, proceed with caution.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Enable two-factor authentication<\/strong> allows you to have one more point of control for account logins, apart from your password. This checkpoint requires the person signing in to verify with another account or device that you have. The types of 2FA offered can include text, email, in-app prompts, biometrics, or even a physical USB stick.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Never use an access link through a message.<\/strong> Always use an official URL and log in directly to your accounts. This is especially important for Instagram phishing email fraud. Scammers are betting that you will react to the urgency in their messages and click to log in without thinking rationally. Always pause and look for the real URL. If there is a real problem, an authentic login will clear it up. You can also follow up with an official support email, chat, or phone line to confirm.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If it sounds too good to be true&#8230; it probably is.<\/strong> Sweepstakes, job, and other scams lure you into money to cloud your judgment. Fortunately, you can assume that these offers are rarely real. If you are curious, you can contact the brands directly through the official channels. Search the web for their real website and contact them to ask about the details of the offer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Always search for official accounts before replying to messages.<\/strong> You may be able to spot authentic brands and people by looking for verified accounts (the ones with a blue checkbox next to their username). The big brands will have links to all the official social networks from their official website. If there is no link to Instagram on their website, it may mean that the brand does not have an official Instagram account. Check the sender&#8217;s profile for suspicious traits, such as posts with too many links or hashtags.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If a stranger follows you, be suspicious.<\/strong> Many scams involve gaining your trust by establishing a relationship with you. It is wise to block unknown followers or those who do not share any mutual followers with you. It may be best to set your account to private and only allow people you know to follow you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If someone you know sends a strange message, contact them directly.<\/strong> Contact the person offline with a phone call or talk to them in person. Ask him if he sent you the message. A scammer may be impersonating them and targeting you and others you know. They may have to report the account and warn the people around them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Use an antivirus program<\/strong> on all your devices. You&#8217;ll want to protect yourself from any malware that might sneak in if you&#8217;ve clicked on a suspicious link. Software like Kaspersky Internet Security offers protection against viruses, ransomware, and even helps block phishing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instagram scams have become overwhelmingly popular among cybercriminals.
