We have listened to our employees, partner developers and player communities, as well as their concerns, and We have made the decision to step back from the NFT market.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Why did they back down?  It&#8217;s simple: they received the <strong>critics<\/strong> both of the <strong>fans<\/strong> of the <strong>games<\/strong> as of the <strong>independent studies<\/strong> with whom they work.

Since the monetization of game time is a future of misery, we ask the group&#8217;s management to stop the development of this technology.&#8221; However, for the moment, the company turned a deaf ear and there is no news regarding the new division, as they seem to be going ahead with their project.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Team17, one of the video game publishers most important in the market, announced a few days ago the intention of launching its own NFT collection based on the mythical characters wormsin collaboration with the blockchain company Reality Gaming Group.
