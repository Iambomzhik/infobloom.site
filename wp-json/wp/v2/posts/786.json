Its president and co-founder, Gabe Newell, has now explained the reasons for his decision, stating that the biggest problems are the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the bad examples behind the uses of these technologies.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview with Rock Paper Shotgun, Newell noted that it&#8217;s important to separate NFT technology from users. The concepts of digital ownership and shared universes are fine by themselves, he said, but <strong>believes the bad examples from the NFT community outweigh any potential positives<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<i><strong>People in this sector tend to be involved in many criminal activities<\/strong> and unclear behaviors<\/i>&#8220;, said. &#8220;<i>So it&#8217;s much more about the actors than the underlying technology.<\/i>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, he explains that these people are not the ones that Valve wants to do business with. For him, the space <strong>is full of people using NFTs as an opportunity to scam customers <\/strong>or engage in money laundering.<\/p>\n<p>Also, when Steam accepted cryptocurrencies as payment for games, the huge volatility that came with it was problematic for users. When it comes to buying everyday items, customers don&#8217;t want the price to fluctuate as much. &#8220;<i>Why one day I spend 497 dollars to buy a game and the next day I spend 47 cents, what is happening here? <strong>Volatility is a bad thing in a medium of exchange<\/strong><\/i>&#8220;, he explained.<\/p>\n<p>He also said that<strong> the vast majority of cryptocurrency transactions on Steam were fraudulent<\/strong>. Although fraud is not something that can be completely eliminated, ideally fraud cases should only contribute to a couple of percentages of total transactions. However, with fraud making up half of all crypto transactions, he said, &#8220;<i>It&#8217;s out of control, right?<\/i>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Regarding the concept of digital property and the metaverse<\/strong>, Newell brought up Final Fantasy 14 in another interview with PCGamer. &#8220;<i>Most people who talk about the metaverse have no idea what they&#8217;re talking about. And apparently they&#8217;ve never played an MMO<\/i>&#8220;he explained.&#8221;<i>They say, &#8216;Oh, you&#8217;ll have this customizable avatar.&#8217; And it&#8217;s like, well&#8230; walk into La Noscea in Final Fantasy 14 and <strong>tell me this isn&#8217;t a problem solved from a decade ago<\/strong>not a fabulous thing that you&#8217;re, you know, making up<\/i>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, Final Fantasy 14 won&#8217;t have NFTs either.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Valve has taken a position against NFTs and cryptocurrencies being allowed on Steam, blocking games that incorporate blockchain technology.
