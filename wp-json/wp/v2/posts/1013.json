The offender sees an opportunity to be credible to people using the contingency, in this case, the Coronavirus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So, <strong>the Service is alert for the detection and warning of these practices so that consumers are not victims of scammers<\/strong>a concern that it shares with protection agencies in other countries.<\/p>\n<p>SERNAC, during May 1 and 19, received <strong>40 citizen alerts<\/strong> that are related to scams and fraud, which is equivalent to a <strong>2.7% of the total received during this period.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Citizen alerts refer mainly to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Phishing scams.<\/li>\n<li>Financing or credit granting scams.<\/li>\n<li>Fake online shopping sales (Facebook, Twitter, Mercado Libre)<\/li>\n<li>Sale of false or fraudulent products.<\/li>\n<li>Identity fraud.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;SIM swapping&#8221; (change of SIM card or cellular chip) or &#8220;SIM hijacking&#8221; (SIM kidnapping)<\/li>\n<li>alleged state aid.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>there are also some <strong>reports of criminals who call on behalf of public organizations, including SERNAC itself,<\/strong> this this case for a supposed &#8220;regularization for the refund for excessive charges in the lines of credit and current accounts&#8221;, in order to <strong>request personal data to commit fraud.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In other versions, <strong>a supposed executive of a department store calls the person informing him that after an inspection by SERNAC<\/strong>, is responsible for the return of insurance and other undue charges, for those who request a series of information, including the security questions of the passwords and procedures that make the person believe that it is indeed the store.  However, later they receive a message informing them that someone tried to access their account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SERNAC has derived citizen complaints and alerts related to fraud within the framework of a permanent coordination agreement with the Public Ministry for its investigation.<\/strong>as well as it has officiated to the corresponding companies to improve the security and information to its clients.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653457200_957_Warning-consumers-about-scams-and-fraud-related-to-the-pandemic.jpg\" alt=\"SERNAC warns consumers about scams and fraud related to the pandemic\" title=\"SERNAC warns consumers about scams and fraud related to the pandemic\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" longdesc=\"articles-58572_imagen_01.longdesc.html\"\/><\/p>\n<h2>phishing<\/h2>\n<p>Phishing refers to deception through the sending of emails that appear to come from trusted sources, such as, for example, from the bank or some institution known to the affected party, which includes links to a website prepared by the criminals, in which they are invited, by means of deception, to enter their personal data.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Federal Trade Commission (FTC)<\/strong> of the United States has warned about <strong>phishing practices<\/strong> recently detected in that country that are related to the Coronavirus.<\/p>\n<p>The antisocials, through phone calls, emails and text messages, offered a &#8220;<strong>covid-19 kits<\/strong>&#8220;. And other scammers, posing as the Federal Government, instructed recipients via text message that they should take a &#8220;mandatory online Covid-19 test&#8221;, sending a link to a website where they requested personal information from people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In Chile, it was detected that various marketplace sites<\/strong> (Intermediary online sales platforms) and social networks offered kits or tests to detect the Coronavirus, products that are not approved by the health authorities.<\/p>\n<p>This same situation was alerted in Peru by the <strong>National Institute for the Defense of Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property (INDECOPI)<\/strong>, simile of SERNAC in this country.  Also in Colombia, through the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce (SIC).<\/p>\n<p>There have also been reports of attempts to <strong>scam related to contracting services such as Nexflix,<\/strong> where, among other modalities, consumers are sent a message to update their keys in order to adjust the value in order to use their personal information to defraud.<\/p>\n<p>In this regard, the same company has warned that personal information will never be requested in an email, including credit card numbers, bank account details, Netflix passwords.<\/p>\n<p>The same situation <strong>has been detected with respect to alleged messages from banks<\/strong> that ask to update information or report that the card has expired asking the consumer to enter a link that is ultimately to commit fraud.<\/p>\n<h2>Food supplements and treatments<\/h2>\n<p>Another of the very common deceptions in different countries refers to the properties that some foods would have to prevent Coronavirus.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense, home remedies such as consuming garlic, large amounts of pepper or dangerous products such as disinfectants, chlorine and its derivatives, or isopropyl alcohol, far from preventing or curing the disease, can cause irreparable damage to those who follow these false recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>Also in marketplaces, it is promoted that certain food supplements, medical treatments or alternative therapies would allow the coronavirus to &#8220;cure&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States, for example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned about the sale of a food supplement made of elemental silver and deionized water that would help &#8220;mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID 19&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coronavirus does not currently have a vaccine or a specific treatment that allows it to be prevented or treated.<\/p>\n<p>In Chile, SERNAC recently denounced a company that promoted treatment for the virus with stem cells, which is also unproven.<\/p>\n<h2>Mobile offices<\/h2>\n<p>Other techniques to deceive consumers have also been detected.  For example, in Mexico, the Federal Consumer Protection Agency (PROFECO) warned about the presence of a mobile office calling itself &#8220;An Angel for Life Covid 19&#8221;, which would cure the Coronavirus.<\/p>\n<h2>Pyramid Scams<\/h2>\n<p>In the current economic scenario, and based on the need to generate resources, the sale of services or products with pyramid schemes can proliferate.<\/p>\n<p>Pyramid selling is a mechanism where the promoters of the so-called &#8220;investment&#8221; schemes enrich themselves directly through the payments made by their recruits.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, it is a highly hierarchical system where a minority earns money, and the majority loses money or products that they must buy to start the business.<\/p>\n<p>These schemes, which are usually deceptive and could even constitute fraud, have been described in various international jurisdictions as &#8220;chain selling&#8221;, &#8220;money games&#8221; or &#8220;investment lotteries&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>It is important for consumers who contract services or buy products to be exhaustive and cautious when reviewing contracts, and avoid falling into the temptation of investment promises with great returns or &#8220;too good to be true&#8221;, since financial services are regulated, and generally have limited returns.<\/p>\n<h2>Recommendations to prevent scams<\/h2>\n<p>In the case of online purchases, the recommendation to consumers is to take care of their personal data.<\/p>\n<p>Internet transactions should only be carried out on the official sites of each bank or commercial house, so it is always advisable to make sure that the address you are entering is the one that corresponds to the institution in question.<\/p>\n<p>If it is a purchase or other transaction, it is important to print and keep the result page of the operation.  This serves as proof for future claims.<\/p>\n<p>Just as consumers must take care of their data, companies have the responsibility to take extreme security measures so that their clients are not victims of fraud, warn of the occurrence of these crimes, recommend prevention measures and clarify valid communication procedures.<\/p>\n<p>In the event of a problem of this type, the first thing consumers should do is block their accounts and file a claim with the bank or financial institution and file a complaint with Police or Investigations.<\/p>\n<h2>Complaints<\/h2>\n<p>When SERNAC detects any scam, it puts the <strong>information available to the Public Ministry for investigation<\/strong>.  For this reason, it calls on consumers to <strong>enter Citizen Alerts<\/strong> in it <strong>Consumer Portal<\/strong> or by calling 800 700 100.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, in e-consumer.gov there is the possibility of filing claims for fraud from companies based in other countries and SERNAC is in permanent coordination with international consumer protection agencies.<\/p>\n<h2>Type of possible scams<\/h2>\n<h3>Online shopping<\/h3>\n<p>Online businesses that pretend to be legitimate, but have fake websites or spoof a legitimate business website.  Either way, once the consumer pays for the product or service, it never arrives.<\/p>\n<h3>Phishing<\/h3>\n<p>It is a type of fraud that uses someone else&#8217;s identity to steal money or get other benefits.  One of the most common is phishing, which tricks the user through an email with some &#8220;unpaid fine&#8221;, &#8220;photographs&#8221; or &#8220;prizes&#8221;, inviting them to follow links to false websites or those that pretend to be the original ones (banks , retail, means of payment, etc.)<\/p>\n<h3>ticket resale<\/h3>\n<p>Internet portals dedicated to the resale of tickets for musical and sports events, among other mass entertainment events.  Sometimes the tickets are not delivered and other times they are, but higher prices are charged than those reported.<\/p>\n<h3>Health and wellness products (miracle products)<\/h3>\n<p>Portals that sell health and wellness products at very low prices and once the consumer pays for the product or service, it never arrives, or they are products that make false promises about their healing or treatment power.<\/p>\n<h3>unexpected prizes<\/h3>\n<p>This type of scam works when someone asks you to pay a certain amount of money in order to receive a prize in a contest or lottery that you never entered.<\/p>\n<h3>pyramid schemes<\/h3>\n<p>Pyramid schemes are a type of scam that tempts people with the idea of \u200b\u200bmaking a lot of money in a short time, but in a very risky way, which can cause people to lose a lot of money.<\/p>\n<h3>investment scams<\/h3>\n<p>This type of scam lures people into investing with the promise of a questionable financial opportunity.<\/p>\n<h3>About price on classified ads pages<\/h3>\n<p>The scammer contacts the seller of a product and points out that they sent\/transferd much more money for the product than it was being sold for, convincing the seller to transfer the difference.<\/p>\n<h3>Junk mail (Spam)<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;Unsolicited mass mailing&#8221;, which means that the recipient has not given verifiable permission for the message to be sent and also the message is sent as part of a mass group of messages, all having similar content.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fraudulent practices are repeated in several countries, so SERNAC is in contact with various protection agencies to share experiences to prevent this type of crime.
