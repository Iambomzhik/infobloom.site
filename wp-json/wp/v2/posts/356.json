In general, nobody gives anything away and, above all, ask yourself, where does the money for those benefits come from?  Surely you are facing a fraud attempt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These types of irresistible offers often hide a scam<\/strong>.  Fake sellers contact the victim offering excellent investment opportunities in stocks, real estate or commodities.  The <strong>main argument<\/strong> to deceive and pressure the victim <strong>is that this opportunity is fleeting and will only be possible if you invest immediately<\/strong>.  Among the most common investment scams we find the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>pyramid schemes<\/strong>: Based on the economic pyramid scheme, but without any real activity or investment. <strong>The benefits received by the members of more seniority are obtained from the money that the new members \u201cinvest\u201d<\/strong>.  For it to work, it is necessary that the number of new participants is greater than the number of existing ones, hence the name it gets from pyramid.  There are always participants who collect benefits, so at first they do not usually raise suspicions.  Besides, <strong>Participants are offered a commission for every new member you get them to join the system<\/strong>.  In this way, for a modest price, scammers get a great deal, since their own victims are in charge of capturing new victims in their closest circle of people.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Binary Options Fraud<\/strong>.  The terrain of these scams moves to the digital framework and to commit the deception they use investment platforms.  Binary investments are totally legal and reliable as long as the broker behind it is legitimate.  The problem comes when it comes to unregulated, unreliable brokers or through unauthorized entities. <strong>The Internet is full of fake online investment platforms or brokers<\/strong>.  To deceive the victim they use a <strong>very simple system based on the generation of trust.<\/strong> It begins with small investments of about \u20ac200 with which the victim makes a profit and believes that he is making a lucrative deal to encourage him to invest larger amounts.  In the end, she loses everything.  Not only will she not be able to recover the funds deposited on the platform, but they can even ask her for more money with the excuse that only then will she be able to recover the investment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Advance payment fraud<\/strong>: The scammers contact the victim to make him believe that he has won a sum of money through an inheritance, a lottery prize or a sweepstakes.  To access the prize you are asked for an amount in advance.  Then she will not receive anything in return.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>How to detect if an investment offer is a scam?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, <strong>study each offer carefully<\/strong>.  If they pressure you or demand previous amounts of money, it is an indicator of a possible fraud attempt.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Search and compare information on the company offering the investment<\/strong>.  In the case of binary options you can find information from other investors on the internet.  Compare as many as you can, as many may be fake and part of the fraud plot.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Check if the broker is registered<\/strong>and therefore it is legitimate, <strong>on the website of the National Securities Market Commission<\/strong> (CNMV).<\/li>\n<li><strong>When you make a transfer<\/strong> banking on your investment, do it <strong>always safely<\/strong>.  Do not use public networks and check that the page is secure by checking that its URL begins with &#8220;https&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>Remember: <strong>There are no miraculous strategies or infallible investment systems<\/strong>.  Avoid overly tempting offers.  These scams are characterized by offering very high and safe returns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The fight against fraud in the Telecommunications sector05\/03\/2018 Programmatic advertising fraud profits cybercriminals at the expense of advertisers04\/17\/2018 If they make you a juicy investment offer in which they guarantee that you will obtain exorbitant returns, be suspicious.
