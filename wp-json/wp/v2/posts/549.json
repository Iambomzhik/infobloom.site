You can also do it directly on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) using DeFi platforms like Featured By Binance, BakerySwap or TreasureLand.  BSC offers low fees, fast transaction times, and has a growing NFT community.<\/p>\n<p>There are many platforms to choose from, but generally, you just need to fill in your NFT details, upload your artwork or digital file, and pay the minting fee.  And if you feel like selling your NFT, you can immediately offer it on various BSC NFT markets.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of the recent NFT (non-fungible token) craze, then you live on another planet.  Celebrities, digital artists and all kinds of creatives are ready to offer their works on the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>From paintings to songs to NBA trading cards, the possibilities open to minting NFTs are endless.  And they&#8217;re also a great way to prove the authenticity and ownership of creative works.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re really talented (or lucky), you might even win a good amount of money.  You could imagine them as a record of a digital collectible or a one-of-a-kind painting.  If your NFT is in significant demand, the price can be astronomical.  You may have heard of visual artist Beeple, who sold an NFT called &#8220;Everydays: the First 5000 Days&#8221; for over $69 million. <\/p>\n<p>Aside from Beeple, other artists sell their NFTs on marketplaces hosted on the blockchain.  The most successful sales speak for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Before you start minting your own NFTs, you are going to need three things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your song, artwork or collectible<\/li>\n<li>A certain amount of crypto to pay the minting fee<\/li>\n<li>A cryptocurrency wallet where you can store them<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will also need to choose the blockchain where you will create your non-fungible token.  We will delve more into this in a bit.<\/p>\n<p>You may be convinced that you want to create an NFT, but do you know exactly what it is?  At the most basic level, it is a cryptocurrency that represents something unique, collectible and cannot be replicated.<\/p>\n<p>A simple analogy for what an NFT is could be a flashy Pok\u00e9mon card.  Anyone can create one, and even make it look just like the real thing.  But it will never be the same thing in the eyes of the collector.<\/p>\n<p>We value the Shining Pokemon Card for its unique nature and authenticity.  And the same goes for an NFT.  Of course, you will be able to download the image or collectible associated with the NFT, but that will not represent its actual ownership or authenticity.<\/p>\n<p>Not even limited series NFTs are all the same.  You could own number 01 of 100 in the series, which would make your unit more valuable than the rest. If you want to know more about the origin of the NFT craze, you better read about the CryptoKitties and CryptoPunks.  Both would be among the first digital collectible projects on the Ethereum network that would enjoy great popularity.<\/p>\n<p>An important question to answer is precisely what an NFT can represent.  Only digital elements or also works of art from the real world?  Although somewhat less common, digital collectibles can also be represented by NFTs.  In this case, the private key of the wallet containing the NFT is usually embedded or provided by the piece.<\/p>\n<p>Christie&#8217;s even auctioned off the blockchain-inspired physical artwork Block 21 (42.36433\u00b0N, -71.26189\u00b0E), featured in &#8220;Portraits of a Mind,&#8221; with an associated NFT in an OpenDime hardware wallet.<\/p>\n<p>Still, it is much more common for digital artwork, songs, gifs, and videos to have their own NFTs.  Even video game collectibles can be represented by NFTs and staking financial products.  Crypto art and NFTs are not limited to a single format, so there are no limits when it comes to creativity applied to your new NFT.<\/p>\n<p>It all depends on the network you decide to create your token on.  Fortunately, most wallets currently support both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, so this shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.  Both blockchains are the most frequently used for NFTs.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing in this case is to check on which blockchain your token was generated.  If it is an Ethereum token, you will need an Ethereum compatible wallet.  If it&#8217;s on Tezos, you&#8217;ll need a Tezos-compatible wallet. To simplify the process, we recommend using MetaMask or Trust Wallet.  These two crypto wallets are compatible with a wide variety of blockchains.  However, it is important that you always check the compatibility of your wallet with the blockchain in which your token is located.<\/p>\n<h2>Which blockchain should you use?<\/h2>\n<p>When creating an NFT you can choose between a few blockchains.  The Ethereum network was the first major blockchain to offer non-fungible tokens as we know them today.  The list of NFT-friendly blockchains includes Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Tron, Tezos, and many others.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, most NFTs are held on Ethereum or BSC.  However, Ethereum&#8217;s gas fees have made NFTs quite expensive to mint and manage.  Binance Smart Chain is a much cheaper alternative, which also benefits from a faster transaction speed.  There are a large number of NFT markets and projects, which gives you a large audience of potential buyers.<\/p>\n<h2>What platform can I use to create NFTs?<\/h2>\n<p>Choosing a platform to mint your NFTs is determined by personal motivations as well as the blockchain you want to use.  Most BSC protocols will create your NFTs as BEP-721 tokens, so no matter what you choose, they will end up being technically the same.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to be able to easily trade your token later, it&#8217;s probably best to choose a platform that is available on the market you&#8217;re familiar with.  This way, you won&#8217;t have to transfer your NFT to a different place after you create it.<\/p>\n<p>For their ease of use, we recommend BakerySwap, Juggerworld, and Treasureland.  All of these BSC projects have simple interfaces and cheap commissions for minting your NFT.  BakerySwap has the main market for NFTs, which makes it a good choice for those who want to sell their NFTs after they are minted.  Treasureland allows you to mint NFTs for free.  If you are thinking of using Ethereum, OpenSea or Rarible are two of the most popular options.<\/p>\n<p>It will be possible to transfer your NFTs from one market to another with ease, as long as the new platform supports your type of token.  In the case of BSC markets and exchanges, the vast majority will be compatible with both BEP-721 and BEP-1155 tokens.  Those are the most common types of NFTs you will find on BSC. What you cannot do is transfer your NFTs directly to a market on another blockchain.  For example, OpenSea does not natively support Binance Smart Chain NFTs.  Although it is possible to &#8220;wrapp&#8221; your tokens, we recommend that you keep your NFTs safe on their original blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>To transfer your NFT to another exchange, send the collectible to your wallet.  Once you have it safely stored, simply send it to the correct deposit address on the new platform.  Always make sure to check that the token standard of your NFT is compatible with your wallet and any platform you send it to.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the Featured by Binance homepage and click [Crear].  You will need to connect your crypto wallet to do that.<\/li>\n<li>Next, you just need to upload your digital files (images, audio, videos, etc.).<\/li>\n<li>Make sure to add a description (metadata) to your NFT.  You will also have to choose between creating individual NFTs or a Collection (a group of NFTs).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>From start to finish, creating an NFT on BakerySwap takes no more than 5 minutes.  Just make sure you have a certain amount of BNB ready for the minting fee \u2013 which at the time of writing is 0.01 BNB \u2013 as well as a cryptocurrency wallet to store it.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that minting fees may change depending on the price of BNB.  If you don&#8217;t already have a wallet, we recommend Trust Wallet for mobile users, and MetaMask for desktop.<\/p>\n<p>With BakerySwap, you will be able to mint:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Images<\/li>\n<li>GIFs<\/li>\n<li>Videos<\/li>\n<li>Audio<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The following steps show you how to create an NFT in BakerySwap.1.  First of all, go to the BakerySwap NFT Market and connect your wallet in the top right corner of the screen.<\/p>\n<p>2. Once you have connected your wallet, click [Mint Artworks] to start creating your NFT.<\/p>\n<p>3. Fill in the required fields with all the information of the collectible.<\/p>\n<p>4. Below your NFT details, click the icon [+] to upload your file.  You will also be able to see what the current minting fee is, just below the anti-plagiarism statement.<\/p>\n<p>5. When you are satisfied with the information filled in and have successfully uploaded your image, make sure you accept the anti-plagiarism statement before clicking [Mint].<\/p>\n<p>6. If you are using MetaMask, a pop-up window will ask you to confirm payment of your minting fee.<\/p>\n<p>7. As soon as you have paid, you will be able to see your NFT in the blockchain through BscScan.  It will be ready to be transferred and traded if you wish.<\/p>\n<p>Treasureland is an NFT marketplace that is part of the BSC Dego Finance project, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol and NFT ecosystem.  Minting NFTs in Treasureland is also free for the creator, since anyone who buys the NFT will pay the commission.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, Treasureland only allows users to coin images and GIFs, but you can choose between single or series NFTs, and set copyrights.1.  To get started, head over to the Treasureland Create section and connect your wallet. <\/p>\n<p>2. You will then be taken to the NFT creation page, where you can fill in all the details of your NFT and upload your image or gif.<\/p>\n<p>3. Please note that Treasureland sets 10% royalties before creating your NFT.<\/p>\n<p>4. Now you can see your NFT or put it up for sale.  If you want to transfer it, you will have to pay the minting fee.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have purchased or created your own NFT, you can send it to another person directly from your wallet.  If your wallet has an NFTs section, you can simply select any of the NFTs you own and click the send option (Trust Wallet and MetaMask offer this option).<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the recipient of your NFT will need to provide you with their correct deposit address for the type of token you hold.  If it is an ERC-721 NFT from the Ethereum network, the recipient will need to send you the Ethereum ERC-721 deposit address from their wallet.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to collaborations, NFTs can be a bit complex these days.  In the case of the most common type NFTs (ERC721, ERC1155, BEP721, BEP1155), it is only possible to have a single owner.<\/p>\n<p>However, some projects have plans to allow profits from a first sale to be split between multiple wallets.  This function is not included in the code of the token, but depends on the exchange or market you use.  We recommend that you check if it is possible to share the amount obtained from the sale, on the particular exchange you are using. If you want to have complete control over your NFTs and want to store them in a non-custodial wallet, you can use a decentralized platform, such as Featured by Binance.<\/p>\n<p>The ecosystem of non-fungible tokens is growing at a high rate and is becoming easier to use.  For those who are interested in creating their own NFTs, the process is quite simple.  Whether you want to create NFTs, buy or sell them, there is a project out there waiting for you to use it.
