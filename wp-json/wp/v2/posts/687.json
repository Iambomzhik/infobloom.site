A non-expendable good is not consumed by its use, cannot be replaced, and is not substitutable.  That is to say, it is <strong>an unrepeatable piece, unique and irreplaceable by another<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" alt=\"invest nft\" class=\"wp-image-761616 lazyload ewww_webp_lazy_load\" title=\"NFTs, are we facing the foolishness of the century?

Why?  Because each digital asset obtains an identifier in which metadata (author&#8217;s name, its initial value or its sales history) is registered through blockchain technology to guarantee that it cannot be duplicated.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to the advent of NFTs, a crypto art craze has sprung up with people involved from all over the world.  At the moment, <strong>the easiest way to make money with NFTs in the online world is through their sale<\/strong>.  Without a doubt, this has made many artists, influencers, athletes, celebrities, companies and organizations jump on this wave that in 2021 generated more than 3 billion euros.<\/p>\n<h3>Advantages and disadvantages of NFTs<\/h3>\n<p>In conventional video games, there are micropayments to purchase things like suits, weapons, and vehicles.  But when you buy a suit, it&#8217;s not really yours because many people can buy it and have the same one.  Instead, using NFTs, anything you buy will be yours alone.  And if you stop liking it or want to get rid of it, <strong>you could sell it even at a more expensive price than what it cost you<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NFTs are also being applied to other sectors such as collections, music, cinema, sports and fashion.<\/strong>.  This has shown that there is private property on the Internet, which helps people have more assets, more properties and therefore more wealth.  <\/p>\n<p><img width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" alt=\"Reasons to buy NFTs\" class=\"wp-image-758847 lazyload ewww_webp_lazy_load\" title=\"NFTs, are we facing the foolishness of the century?

According to Chainalysis stats, <strong>9% of NFT owners hold 80% of market value<\/strong>.  It is also necessary to point out that there is no return on investment and that there have been many chaos of fraud\/scams.  In addition, doubts also arise regarding its regulation due to the payment of taxes and high energy consumption that cryptocurrency transactions require.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs are definitely not the nonsense of the century, as there are many people who have benefited from them and continue to do so at this point in 2022. However, there is also a large group of people who have been victims of scams, fraud or who they simply invested in an NFT and did not make any kind of profit.  In conclusion, NFTs are a double-edged sword because just as there are some that can make you money, unfortunately others could make the exact opposite happen.  Either way, <strong>Everything indicates that NFTs are here to stay<\/strong> and that it is not a passing fad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you want to know more about it?<\/strong> Well, take a look at this article with five reasons why it is worth buying NFTS and five why it is not.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since NFTs arrived in our society, many people in the world have made and lost money with them.
