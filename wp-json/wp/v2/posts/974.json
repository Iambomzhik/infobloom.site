This will ask you as if it were another survey;  having to fill it out as soon as possible.  Only then can you ensure that Toluna sends you surveys on a daily basis!<\/p>\n<p>To correctly fill out your Toluna Influencers profile, try to take into account the following:<br \/>Try to place in &#8220;level of education&#8221; bachelor&#8217;s, diploma or doctorate.<br \/>Put between 20,000 and 40,000 dollars per year in the question of what is your income.  If you do not manage with dollars then you have the conversion to the currency you use by entering here.<\/p>\n<p>Denote that you are employed and in a mid-level position when asked about your job.<br \/>Answer yes to the question of whether you are responsible for your home purchases.<br \/>Indicate that you have at least one child under the age of 18.  Similarly, indicate that more than three people live in your house.<br \/>Responding in this way will guarantee that the platform sends you a large number of surveys and, therefore;  that you have more opportunities to make money filling out online surveys.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that these kinds of web pages are looking for people who buy, go on a trip or spend money in a high and continuous way in their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">go to Toluna MX registration page <\/p>\n<h2>Opinions and final conclusion about Toluna Influencers<\/h2>\n<p>I&#8217;m not really going to lie to you; <strong>Mexico<\/strong> is one of my favorite websites to monetize doing surveys.  They always send you just the right amount of surveys so you can make some extra money and not completely disengage from the platform.  Is trustworthy;  fast and they always pay, although sometimes it can take up to 2 weeks to pay.  Still, it is safe to use this platform.<\/p>\n<p>Its catalog of rewards is very varied and you can also exchange your points for cash from PayPal. <\/p>\n<p>The only negative thing I can observe about the platform is that the rewards vary depending on the country you are in.  In addition, you need to collect at least $35 in points (which is approximately 140,000 points) to withdraw the rewards.  It is something high without a doubt, but it is not impossible to reach this goal.<\/p>\n<p>I highly recommend this platform as it is easy to use, simple and pays on time in most cases.
