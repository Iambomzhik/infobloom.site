However, cryptocurrencies are not the only technologies that are attracting the interest of investors and enthusiasts in the sector.<\/p>\n<p>One of the topics that is generating the most interest is the creation of tokens whose main characteristic is not to be carried out in a fungible way.  That is, the tokens are not equal to another token.<\/p>\n<p>These types of tokens are called Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and that is what we are going to cover in this article.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What are NFTs?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>NFTs are tokens that cannot be exchanged for other tokens of the same class.  Each token has a unique value, and this is because each token is tied to a particular object or entity.<\/p>\n<p>For example, imagine you have a house and you want to sell it.  You can issue a token linked to that house, and this token will have the same value as the house has.  Another example is that of coins.  Each coin has a unique value as it is backed by a precious metal.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs are based on blockchain technology, which gives them a number of advantages over other tokens.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Advantages of NFTs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>1. Security: Security is one of the main advantages of NFTs.  Being based on the blockchain, they are protected against theft and counterfeiting.<\/p>\n<p>2. Privacy: NFTs are supported in the ERC-721 protocol.  This means that the data is public, but not identifiable from it, since each token has a unique ID.<\/p>\n<p>3. Easy to use: NFTs are easy to use as they work with the same tools as cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>4. Traceability: Traceability is another advantage of NFTs.  Token data is available at any time and you can easily access it.<\/p>\n<p>5. Severability: A very common feature among NFTs is that they can be divided into parts.  The token is not divided into units, but the parts are equal to the whole.<\/p>\n<p>6. Easy to link: NFTs are very easily linked to other accounts and platforms.<\/p>\n<p>7. Higher value: NFTs have a higher value than other tokens as they are backed by real objects.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Disadvantages of NFTs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>1. Lower liquidity: The lower liquidity of NFTs is one of their main disadvantages.  This is mainly due to the fact that there are fewer people interested in this type of token, since you cannot exchange them with others as you can with cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>2. Trust: Trust is another weak point of NFTs.  There are cases in which people still do not understand the operation and the real value of these tokens, and for this reason they condition possible transactions with them.<\/p>\n<p>3. Cannot be invoked: As NFTs are unique, they cannot be invoked for use by other tokens or platforms.  For example, if you issued a token tied to one house, it cannot be used to pay rent on another.<\/p>\n<p>4. Lower exchange rate: The lower exchange rate is another disadvantage of NFTs.  This is because these tokens are generally not bought or sold, but used for some practical purpose.<\/p>\n<p>5. Minable Schemes: Minable schemes are another downside of NFTs.  Since everyone can access them, you don&#8217;t need an incentive from the developers to make decisions or transactions.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why should you bet on NFTs?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>1. Digital items: NFTs are a good alternative to digital items.  Currently, there are few platforms on which these objects can be stored, and most of them are owned by large companies.<\/p>\n<p>2. The creation economy: NFTs help new economies emerge, as they provide an incentive for the development of platforms and tokens.<\/p>\n<p>3. Decentralized ecosystem: NFTs are part of the decentralized ecosystem, and are not controlled or supported by central entities.  This means that the information is stored on a public network, but without the possibility of anyone controlling it.<\/p>\n<p>4. Higher investment: Investing in NFTs is a good opportunity to obtain good long-term returns.  This is because the market for these tokens is still in its infancy, and the potential profits are even higher.<\/p>\n<p>5. Greater stability: NFTs offer greater stability than other tokens, so there is no chance that they will disappear or change the amount initially created.<\/p>\n<p>6. Tax regime: The taxation of NFTs is more beneficial than that applied to cryptocurrencies, since you can enjoy a longer period of time to return the corresponding tax.<\/p>\n<p>7. Safe investment: NFTs are much safer investments, since there is no chance that a better technology will appear to compete with them and erase all the profits initially generated.<\/p>\n<p>8. Provision of data: Although it is not an advantage, NFTs provide more information to the digital world, since you can know exactly what object you are linking with when you make a transaction.<\/p>\n<p>9. Speed \u200b\u200bof transactions: NFTs have a higher rate than conventional tokens, since the process for their creation and management is simpler and more productive.<\/p>\n<p>10. Greater stability: NFTs offer a higher level of stability than other tokens, so there is no chance of them disappearing or changing the amount initially created.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Where are NFTs kept?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>NFTs are kept in a variety of places, depending on the goal being sought with them.  For example, if you want to use them to sell them in a market, they will be stored in an exchange house, in case you want to save them for a future investor, they will be stored in a portfolio or wallet.<\/p>\n<p>Also, each blockchain has its own way of managing NFTs: Ethereum uses metadata and ERC721, while Bitcoin and Litecoin use a special address.  For this reason, it is important to know the characteristics of each blockchain in order to use NFTs in the best possible format.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you want to make an investment with NFTs, you need to have a wallet that you can use to store them.  This is because the use of these tokens requires some type of management in one place, and if you do not have access to this data or medium, it will be difficult for you to use them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cryptocurrencies have become an interesting trend in the financial world in recent years, thanks to their decentralized and anonymous nature.
