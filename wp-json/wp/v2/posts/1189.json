The mitigations are <strong>Circumstances that reduce or lessen criminal liability<\/strong>.  In this way, they serve to adjust a sentence to the specific circumstances of each case.<\/p>\n<p>The following are extenuating circumstances of criminal responsibility:<\/p>\n<p>In addition, article 23 of the Penal Code includes the <strong>mixed circumstance of kinship,<\/strong> that can mitigate or aggravate responsibility depending on the motives, effects and nature of the crime.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is a circumstance that can mitigate or aggravate responsibility, depending on the nature, motives and effects of the crime, being or having been the aggrieved spouse or person who is or has been linked in a stable way by analogous relationship of affectivity, or being ascendant, descendant or brother by nature or adoption of the offender or his spouse or partner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 23 of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Types of mitigators<\/h2>\n<p>The Penal Code establishes a list of seven extenuating circumstances that <strong>We can classify defenses as incomplete, ordinary attenuating and analog attenuating<\/strong>.  Let&#8217;s see them in more detail.<\/p>\n<h3>incomplete defenses<\/h3>\n<p>Incomplete defenses are those that exempt from criminal responsibility in cases in which <strong>not meet all the necessary requirements for said exemption to occur<\/strong>.  That is, they are in an intermediate state between total responsibility and complete lack of responsibility.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They are extenuating circumstances:<\/p>\n<p>1st The causes expressed in the previous chapter, when all the necessary requirements to exempt from responsibility in their respective cases do not concur.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 21.1 of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In cases in which an incomplete defense is applied, the determination of the penalty is not carried out according to the ordinary rules modifying the responsibility of article 66, but rather <strong>the specific rule of article 68 applies<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>According to this precept, <strong>when there is an incomplete defense, the reduction of the sentence is maintained by one degree in a mandatory manner<\/strong>in addition to the reduction in two degrees on an optional basis.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the cases provided for in the first circumstance of article 21, the judges or courts will impose the lower penalty by one or two degrees than that indicated by law, taking into account the number and entity of the requirements that are missing or concur, and the personal circumstances. of its author, without prejudice to the application of article 66 of this Code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 68 of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Ordinary extenuating<\/h3>\n<p>The ordinary extenuating<strong> are the circumstances expressly provided as such in the law<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As we have already pointed out, the ordinary extenuating circumstances are addiction to psychotropic substances, a state of passion, confession, reparation for the damage caused and extraordinary and undue delay in processing the procedure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This last extenuating circumstance was included in the 2010 reform<\/strong>.  In this way, the fundamental elements of the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court were collected, which has configured this circumstance as a mitigating circumstance by analogy.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2nd That of acting guilty because of his serious addiction to the substances mentioned in number 2 of the previous article.<\/p>\n<p>3rd That of acting for causes or stimuli so powerful that they have produced outburst, blindness or another passionate state of similar entity.<\/p>\n<p>4th That of having proceeded the guilty, before knowing that the judicial procedure is directed against him, to confess the infraction to the authorities.<\/p>\n<p>5th That of having proceeded the culprit to repair the damage caused to the victim, or reduce its effects, at any time of the procedure and prior to the oral trial.<\/p>\n<p>6th Extraordinary and undue delay in the processing of the procedure, provided that it is not attributable to the accused himself and that it is not proportionate to the complexity of the case.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Article 21 of the Penal Code<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Analog attenuators<\/h3>\n<p>Analogous or analogous extenuating circumstances encompass all circumstances similar to those listed in article 21 of the Penal Code.
