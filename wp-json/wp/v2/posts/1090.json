It seemed like a bargain to me. I thought I had been very lucky,&#8221; she recalls.  What seemed like fortune was a scam: when she was shown the flat, she paid 400 euros on the spot to reserve it.  The person who showed him the property disappeared.  She is still waiting for the trial to be held to recover her money.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The case of Mart\u00edn-Consuegra is one of the many scams around the rental market, strengthened thanks to the rise in prices: the cost of rentals has grown by 50% in the last five years.  The situation is particularly suffocating for young people, installed in precarious conditions and with few purchase options.  Renting is pretty much your only option.  &#8220;They take advantage of anyone&#8217;s need,&#8221; says Mart\u00edn-Consuegra.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;In these weeks of September there are many scams involving rent. Many parents are looking for a flat for their children, who are going to start studying in another city, and the scammers use that circumstance,&#8221; Ra\u00fal L\u00f3pez explains to Verne by phone. head of the Electronic Commerce Fraud Section of the Central Cybercrime Unit.  The scammers take advantage of the difficulties of these people to go to the flat in person.  These scams are usually similar, but there are nuances that differentiate each one.  These are some of the most widespread.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Airbnb scam<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is one of the most common scams.  Film director Rodrigo Cort\u00e9s told on Twitter at the end of August how they tried to rip him off with this technique.  And we have seen it firsthand: a Verne editor also suffered a similar attempt.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The modus operandi is always the same.  The house is advertised in Idealista or in some other similar page.  Once you have contacted, instead of continuing the conversation through the app&#8217;s messaging service, they answer you by email.  The scammers explain that they live far away and that to show you the flat you have to pay a deposit.  Without that payment you cannot see the flat.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the conversation continues, the scammers send you a link to the alleged Airbnb home.  However, it is not a link to this platform: it is a trap website with which they execute the scam and that mimics the appearance of the vacation rental portal.  &#8220;The bait is always the bargain. You have to be very careful with them,&#8221; adds the National Police electronic fraud expert.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;They will want to close the sale or rental in a very short period of time and, furthermore, they will not object to any request made to them, no matter how extravagant it may be,&#8221; explains the Internet Security Office.  This scam has been executed with both real and invented apartment addresses.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The scam of the ambassador who just moved<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The houses that are promoted with this type of scams usually seem very luxurious.  As with the Airbnb scam, they advertise through websites like Idealista or Fotocasa.  The scammer presents himself as an owner who lives abroad and is looking for someone who will take good care of the house he has in Spain.  It is very common for them to claim to have worked in an embassy in Spain and that they have been transferred to another country.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This scam does not use Airbnb as a hook.  The scammer requests a transfer through a specialized money transfer company, such as MoneyGram or Western Union.  The scammer ensures that with that amount you demonstrate your interest in the house.  They promise you that, once you have made the transfer, you will receive the key to the property.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"es\">If you are looking for a rental \ud83c\udfe0, avoid falling into traps:<br \/>\u2611 Prices too juicy<br \/>\u2611 Overseas landlord asking for advance payment pic.twitter.com\/Zxs6rnIOqx<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 National Police (@policia) June 10, 2019<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Looking for confidential information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In some cases, scammers don&#8217;t go straight for your money.  They chase personal information and then reach your pocket.  This type of digital scam is called phishing.  The scammer sends an email that appears to be from Idealista, Fotocasa or some other similar website.  It claims data such as passwords or email addresses, with which it can then introduce malicious software on your computer and obtain the information it wants.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From there they can access your files or the personal information you save on your computer, such as your online banking passwords.  Phishing is also carried out by impersonating other widely used websites, such as social networks, banks or email services.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"es\">You have received a suspicious email\u203c\ufe0f:<br \/>\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffbMisspellings <br \/>\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffbPoorly constructed phrases<br \/>\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb The sender of the email does not correspond to the entity or company of the mail<br \/>DON&#8217;T PICK, it&#8217;s #PHISHING \ud83c\udfa3 pic.twitter.com\/xW2QZ5oJRv<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 National Police (@policia) February 28, 2019<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Abusive conditions: they are not scams, but they are illegal<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Landlords can be very demanding of tenants.  Very much.  As we explain in this article, it is not illegal for them to claim personal information, such as a copy of your employment contract, the latest payslips, or even a bank statement.  They can even make it a condition for the rent that the tenant reforms the house.<\/p>\n<p>But there are abusive clauses prosecuted by law.  For example, real estate agencies cannot claim more than one month&#8217;s deposit, which must be equivalent to one month&#8217;s rent.  However, there is no defined limit for the months of deposit.  On the other hand, contracts whose duration is less than three years can be considered null.  Like those that include excessive penalties if the tenant leaves the apartment: compensation can be included for which you must pay the equivalent of one month for each year remaining on the contract.<\/p>\n<h2>Tips for identifying scams disguised as bargains<\/h2>\n<p>These are the tips from the Internet Security Office to avoid scams related to renting flats:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Be wary of very low rental prices.  If you are interested in a specific location, make a comparison with the rest of the rentals in the area.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Be suspicious if you detect that the photos of the house are copied from another website (they contain watermarks) or if they are the same as those seen in other ads.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not trust owners who live abroad and for some reason cannot show you the apartment in person.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not trust if they suggest you use intermediaries for the delivery of the keys or the contract.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The rush should put you on alert.  Cybercriminals are always in a hurry to close the deal as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are requested to pay anonymously through money transfer services, do not continue with the process.  Nor if a transfer is requested to a bank that is not of the same nationality as the &#8220;alleged owner&#8221;.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"nota_pie\">* You can also follow us on Instagram and Flipboard.
