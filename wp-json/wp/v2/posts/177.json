The entry into this world of personalities as relevant as Gerard Piqu\u00e9 or the popular <i>youtuber <\/i>Willyrex, have made many young people interested in this technology and see it as an opportunity to earn money.  Something that has generated concern and concern in many users of social networks. <\/p>\n<p data-gtm-element-container=\"modulo-texto-link\" class=\"paragraph\">But what are NFTs really and what practical application do they have?  The Non Fungible Token (non-fungible token) are nothing more than certificates of authenticity of digital works.  A market that has exploded thanks to millionaire acquisitions such as<i> Everydays: The first 5000 days<\/i>from the digital artist Beeple, for something 58 million euros or the sale of the first tweet of Jack Dorsey (founder of Twitter) for 1.7 million euros.<\/p>\n<p>        Also read AFP AFP<source media=\"(min-width: 480px)\" data-><img data-full-src=\"https:\/\/www.lavanguardia.com\/uploads\/2021\/03\/06\/6043c54405ca4.jpeg\" alt=\"Horizontal\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651651948_525_The-for-dummies-explanation-of-how-NFTs-work-that-has.jpeg\" class=\"lazy\"\/><\/source><\/p>\n<p data-gtm-element-container=\"modulo-texto-link\" class=\"paragraph\">The proof to prove that a digital work belongs to you is given by the reliability provided by the blockchain technology called <i>blockchain<\/i>.  The same system used by cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to validate transactions.<\/p>\n<p data-gtm-element-container=\"modulo-texto-link\" class=\"paragraph\">But owning a digital work does not prevent other users from viewing it and even downloading it.  The only difference is that the owner has a digital certificate that accredits him as the owner of the works and this is recorded in the block chain deeds. <\/p>\n<p data-gtm-element-container=\"modulo-texto-link\" class=\"paragraph\">Thus, we can determine that the intention of the NFTs is to provide value to unique works of the 2.0 world to be collected, sold or exchanged.  Their practical application is the stuff of constant debate on social media, and Twitter user @Angel_monium has further ignited it by posting a screenshot of a YouTube comment explaining how NFTs work &#8220;for dummies.&#8221; <\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">Explaining how NFTs work for dummies pic.twitter.com\/DGHnMOzgON<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 \ud83d\udda4 \u1d2c\u207f\u1d4d\u1d49\u02e1\u1d50\u1d52\u207f\u2071\u1d58\u1d50 \ud83e\udd0d \u2093\u1d62\u2092\u2099 \ud83d\udc9c (@Angel_monium) December 14, 2021\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p data-gtm-element-container=\"modulo-texto-link\" class=\"paragraph\">The author of the comment ironically compares NFTs with companies that charge for giving away or naming stars: &#8220;Has something changed when you bought it?
