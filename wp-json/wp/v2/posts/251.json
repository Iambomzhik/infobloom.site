But what exactly are NFTs? Why are people paying a fortune for something intangible like a tweet, a meme, or a digital reproduction of a print when they can just as easily watch it for free online?<\/p>\n<p class=\"notTexto\">Decentralized finances are a set of applications based on &#8216;blockchain&#8217; networks that, in principle, do not need intermediaries to function. The rise of these financial products, which have characteristics similar to traditional services, could change the finance sector to some extent and brings with it opportunities and challenges.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs allow any virtual object to be associated with a certificate of authenticity that makes it a unique piece. Enrique Sotomayor, CEO of Kolokium Blockchain Technologies, explains that an NFT is &#8220;a unique and indivisible digital item, which is not consumed when using it and cannot be replaced by another.&#8221; When you want to create a digital representation of a work of art, for example, &#8220;a &#8216;smart contract&#8217; is programmed that contains said information and also the rules of<strong> how it will be submitted to the different transactions,<\/strong> in this case, buying and selling\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs use the same technology as cryptocurrencies. What differentiates them, as Sotomayor points out, is the information and instructions contained in the codes of said smart contracts. \u201cThe main difference is that the <strong>cryptocurrencies<\/strong> they can be consumed and can be replaced by other equivalent units, that is, they are fungible\u201d, comments the expert.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, just over 400 tweets were sold through a platform called Valuables and $75,000 in total was offered in those auctions. Another example would be the Nyan Cat meme, an animated flying cat that leaves a trail of rainbows, which sold in February for more than $500,000. In this context, even some &#8216;youtubers&#8217; are considering putting their own collection of NTFs up for sale.<\/p>\n<p>But the rise of digital collecting is not entirely new. Oscar Lage, head of Cybersecurity and Blockchain at Tecnalia, explains that &#8220;the fever&#8221; began in 2017 with the CryptoKitties platform, which allowed users to buy and &#8216;breed&#8217; kittens with different combinations of colors and characteristics, with the possibility of selling them later. to other users. These collectible cats &#8220;made operating on the network much more expensive than usual due to the furor they caused.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few weeks ago, Jack Dorsey sold the first tweet in history in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) for $2.9 million.
