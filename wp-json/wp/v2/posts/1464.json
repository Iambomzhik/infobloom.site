Let&#8217;s face it, most people looking for this want <strong>snoop on the chats of your partner, girlfriend or husband<\/strong>.  The reason?  Although we are not going to talk about these issues in this <strong>technology blog<\/strong>we assume that it is due to jealousy or suspicions of infidelity.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, these people come to <strong>Internet<\/strong> mainly to find out how they can achieve this, without even knowing the dangers they are exposing themselves to and the consequences that this could cause them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"has-background has-text-align-center has-very-light-gray-background-color\"> <strong>Safety pin:<\/strong> 41 WhatsApp tricks you didn&#8217;t know<\/p>\n<p>In this article we will show you how some of the main web pages and applications work that ensure you can <strong>hack anyone&#8217;s WhatsApp in a matter of seconds<\/strong>with only the telephone number of the \u201cvictim\u201d.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"paginas-hackear-espiar-whatsapp\">Pages to Hack and Spy on WhatsApp<\/h2>\n<p>There is a proliferation of scam websites of all kinds on the Internet that try to trick users in order to obtain money.  And the scams about the most popular instant messaging application are no exception.<\/p>\n<p>When conducting searches on the Internet (mainly Google) about <strong>how to spy or hack whatsapp with mobile number<\/strong>in the first results appear these malicious websites that deceive users into believing that they will be able to spy on a person&#8217;s WhatsApp without them noticing.<\/p>\n<p>Of all these sites, here we show you how the most popular websites work, such as Hackingtor WhatsApp, and in which many unwary people fall:<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"espiar-whatsapp\">Spy WhatsApp<\/h3>\n<p>The most popular and the one that ranks best in search engines is this unethical website to \u201cspy on WhatsApp\u201d (espiarwapp.com).<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Upon entering the web, we find a \u201cSpy now\u201d button.  Clicking on it shows us a window to enter the phone number.  The country of the cell phone number does not matter (Mexico, Argentina, Spain, etc.), because \u201cthe service is international\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"762\" height=\"396\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825290_576_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.png\" alt=\"WhatsApp number to spy\" class=\"wp-image-4268\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/p>\n<p>After entering the number and clicking the button, the process of the alleged \u201chack\u201d will start.  Of course, <strong>this does nothing<\/strong>just making you waste your time.<\/p>\n<p>When finished, it takes us to a page with the supposed information that it obtained from the entered number.  Here you will see information on the number of conversations, images, videos, voice notes, total file size, the WhatsApp HASH and the date of the attack.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, <strong>these data are false<\/strong>.  In fact, whatever number we enter, it will always show this same data.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1128\" height=\"661\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825291_200_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.png\" alt=\"WhatsApp spy scam\" class=\"wp-image-4272\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/p>\n<p>It also shows us two &#8220;private servers&#8221; to access WhatsApp Web.  This to supposedly read the WhatsApp messages of the other mobile.<\/p>\n<p>This is where unsuspecting users fall for this scam and end up clicking on these buttons.  These links do not lead to any server, but to <strong>advertising pages to install some browser extension or to subscribe to some premium service.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"715\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825291_97_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.png\" alt=\"advertising page\" class=\"wp-image-4274\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/>Example of an advertising page to which the links to spy on WhatsApp take you.<\/p>\n<p>Here, do not enter your card details for any reason, since you will be subscribed to a premium service.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"hackear-whatsapp\">hack whatsapp<\/h3>\n<p>Another misleading website that promises <strong>hack a whatsapp number in a matter of seconds<\/strong> is Hackear.co.

After entering a cell phone number (valid or not), the web begins to &#8220;work&#8221; showing the supposed requests to the server, brute force attacks to hack WhatsApp, exploiting vulnerabilities in the database, until finishing with the &#8220;hacking&#8221; .<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"865\" height=\"781\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825292_201_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.png\" alt=\"WhatsApp hacking scam website\" class=\"wp-image-4280\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/p>\n<p>At the end, it shows us the <strong>supposed hacked WhatsApp data.<\/strong> False information from chats, photos, videos, audios, documents and number of contacts.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"830\" height=\"899\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825292_390_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.png\" alt=\"Scam hack whatsapp with number\" class=\"wp-image-4284\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Unlike the previous service, this data is random, to try to confuse the user and thus end up falling for the scam.<\/p>\n<p>To make it more credible, they post false user reviews attesting that the service works.<\/p>\n<p>The deception lies in the \u201cDownload data\u201d button.  If you click on this button you will be redirected to a <strong>advertising website where they request to register to be subscribed to a multimedia service<\/strong> (movies, music, books, etc.)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1170\" height=\"709\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825292_174_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.png\" alt=\"False advertising page\" class=\"wp-image-4281\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Again, let&#8217;s avoid falling for these scams believing that we will be able to hack WhatsApp online for free without a credit card and without surveys.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"hackingtor-whatsapp\">hacker whatsapp<\/h3>\n<p>The popular website to spy on WhatsApp with Hackingtor could not be missing.

After entering a mobile phone number, the website starts to \u201cdownload the hacked data\u201d.  Upon reaching 100%, it tells us that the WhatsApp account has been successfully hacked.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the previous websites, Hackingtor WhatsApp does not show the account data.  It directly shows you a button to \u201cdownload the complete message history\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>As you have probably already realized, <strong>spy whatsapp with Hackingtor is not possible.<\/strong> Clicking on the download button will take us to an advertising page.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"642\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825293_459_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.png\" alt=\"Advertising spy with Hackingtor\" class=\"wp-image-4291\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Remember that it does not matter that these websites have secure HTTPS encryption.  Any website can have this SSL certificate, so it does not guarantee that it is a trustworthy site.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"aplicaciones-espiar-whatsapp\">WhatsApp Spy Apps<\/h2>\n<p>In Google Play there are some applications that claim to be able to spy on WhatsApp for free without a credit card from another mobile and without them noticing.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"508\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825294_958_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.jpg\" alt=\"Apps to spy whatsapp\" class=\"wp-image-4305\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/p>\n<p>And although some of these applications indicate that they are a joke, there are others that are not.  You can come across apps like Whats Detective (which promises to see your partner&#8217;s WhatsApp messages) or WhatsApp Spy (to find out who someone is talking to).<\/p>\n<p>These applications have been and continue to be downloaded by thousands or even millions of people.<\/p>\n<p>But\u2026 <strong>What do the creators of these apps earn if they are free?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thanks to advertising and in-app payments, these applications make their creators earn large sums of money.  All this taking advantage of the ignorance of users.<\/p>\n<p>This does not happen on iOS devices, because in the Apple Store they are stricter to accept an application in their store.  On Android, however, this is very common.  Not only because of the deceptive applications that proliferate in the Google store, but also because of the dangerous APKs that are out there on the net.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best known is<strong> <\/strong>WhatsApp Sniffer, an app that was born to <strong>spy on the conversations of users connected to the same WiFi network<\/strong>, but it was finally removed from Google Play for obvious reasons.  Although currently it is still offered as an APK on many sites.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that these apps, like the websites mentioned above, <strong>they are just a hoax<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>What do they do then?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Any.<\/strong> They only \u201cbombard\u201d you with advertising and -in the worst case- they try to get you to subscribe to paid services to charge you a certain amount of money every month.  Avoid them!<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"se-puede-hackear-whatsapp\">Can WhatsApp be hacked or not?<\/h2>\n<p>At this point you may be wondering <strong>whether it is possible to hack whatsapp or not<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that hacking an application like this, with a very high level of security, <strong>it is an almost impossible task<\/strong>.  Only available to experienced hackers who exploit vulnerabilities, inject malware, or other tactics beyond the knowledge of the average user.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, believing that a page or application is going to be able to hack anyone&#8217;s account in a matter of seconds is absurd.<\/p>\n<p>So stop using programs or pages that promise to spy on someone&#8217;s WhatsApp with only their mobile number.  \u00a1<strong>It&#8217;s not possible!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"693\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825294_806_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.jpg\" alt=\"Is it possible to Hack Whatsapp or not\" class=\"wp-image-4310\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/><\/p>\n<p>What is possible, and anyone can do it, is to use the <strong>social engineering<\/strong>.  That is, take advantage of people&#8217;s ignorance to reveal their data.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, there are also those who convince or take advantage of people&#8217;s carelessness to borrow their phone for a few seconds, enough time to get all their WhatsApp conversations for free.<\/p>\n<p>How?<\/p>\n<p>Basically, take the victim&#8217;s cell phone and log in to WhatsApp Web to see all their private chats.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"391\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1653825294_112_Hacking-and-Spying-WhatsApp-with-Phone-Number-Is-it-Possible.jpg\" alt=\"whatsapp web\ufeff\" class=\"wp-image-5677\"   data-recalc-dims=\"1\"\/>whatsapp web\ufeff<\/p>\n<p>Even if your phone is locked, they can install the WhatsApp app on their phones and<strong> log in with your number by verifying by calling your own mobile phone (for which you do not need to unlock it)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, this can be done by anyone, without having great computer skills.  Therefore, be careful who you lend your cell phone to.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, you should know that spying on another person&#8217;s WhatsApp conversations (be it a friend, co-worker, partner or family member) is a crime in several countries.
