They are very popular in the world of cryptocurrencies and are gaining popularity in other sectors as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">Can you even believe a GIF file sold for $590,000 at auction?  Now, you may be wondering what that GIF file will contain.  Well, it was just Nyan the cat.  NFT that gained so much wealth to the creator.  Isn&#8217;t that shocking?<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>What if I told you there is more?<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">You may be surprised to learn that Beeple sold an NFT art for $69 million.  That is the power of NFT in this modern world.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">Now, let&#8217;s understand a bit more about NFTs to get a better idea of \u200b\u200bthem.<\/p>\n<h3>What are NFTs?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) is a digital certificate of authenticity.  At present, NFTs are known to be the most popular things.  NFTs can be easily understood as digital tokens that can include digital arts, digital assets, music, video, or any other asset in the digital world that is built on blockchain technology.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">If you ever visit an auction, you&#8217;ll see classic artwork, antiques, vinyl, first edition books, and other historical items being sold there.  These items are certified to be authentic.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-64663 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Challenges-and-risks-associated-with-non-fungible-tokens-NFTs.jpg\" alt=\"NFT\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\"  \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">NFTs are created with a similar concept, but their existence is in the digital world.  NFTs can allow any video, MP3, image, GIF, or any other file format and certify it as unique.  Previously, there was no technology available for the ownership of digital assets.  You can now claim ownership of your digital assets due to blockchain technology.<\/p>\n<p>You can collect, sell, buy, or even destroy NFTs in the digital world.  Blockchain technology will keep a record of every transaction you make, along with the price of that NFT, visible to everyone on the internet.<\/p>\n<h3>NFTs and games<\/h3>\n<p>When we talk about NFT, the first thing that people usually associate it with is gaming.  The great thing about NFTs is that you can change the digital ownership of any digital asset.  Until now, we have not been able to own any digital assets.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever players used to buy some game items, they considered them their own.  Actually, they belonged to game publishers.  For example, if you have a lot of in-game items in League of Legends and the publisher decides to shut down the game, you end up losing all digital assets.<\/p>\n<p>Now the scenario has completely changed.  The creators of the game do not have centralized control over the Crypto kittens and NFT collectibles because they are managed through smart contracts.  So even if the game goes dark tomorrow, you can easily transfer or sell your crypto kitties.  That sounds amazing, right?<\/p>\n<p>Previously, game items were never unique.  Due to the concept of NFTs, you can now create items with different characteristics and also give them a personal touch.  Crypto kittens have fueled the foundation of NFTs in the gaming world, as well as other industries.<\/p>\n<p>Well, not everything is so good on the NFT side.  There are also certain challenges and risks associated with them.  Let&#8217;s review one by one.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the challenges and risks of NFTs?<\/h3>\n<p>Non-fungible tokens are generating huge profits for digital creators.  There are many works of art being sold online every day.  It is even possible for a creator to make millions in just a few seconds when their NFT is sold in the digital space.  It is also visible that people buy, sell and invest with more enthusiasm in the digital market instead of doing the same in the physical market.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-64661 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651586988_985_Challenges-and-risks-associated-with-non-fungible-tokens-NFTs.jpg\" alt=\"CHALLENGES\" width=\"1000\" height=\"820\"  \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">This leads to a significant increase in the possibility of cyber-attacks and online fraud.  There are high chances of harm to digital assets and investors who buy and sell NFTs in the market.  Although there is great potential for the NFT market, there are certain risks that need to be considered.<\/p>\n<p>If you are thinking of entering the NFT market, then you need to understand these risks and challenges with NFT to get a better idea.<\/p>\n<h3>Risks of smart contracts and NFT maintenance<\/h3>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">The risk of smart contracts and the maintenance of NFTs is one of the main ones that is currently prevalent in the NFT market.  There are several scenarios where hackers attack a DeFi (decentralized finance) network and steal a large amount of crypto.  Recently, the most famous DeFi protocol called Poly Network was attacked by hackers and $600 million was stolen in this NFT theft.  The reason behind that theft was because the security of the smart contracts was not adequate.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-64664 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651586989_667_Challenges-and-risks-associated-with-non-fungible-tokens-NFTs.jpg\" alt=\"Smart Contracts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"802\"  \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">Hackers successfully exploited smart contract flaws to perform a large-scale attack on the Poly network.  The Poly network is very useful for exchanging tokens on different blockchain networks.  This tells us that if smart contracts have even a small flaw, they cannot be expected to be complete.  security.<\/p>\n<h3>Assessment challenges<\/h3>\n<p>The main challenge facing the NFT market is the uncertainty in determining the price of NFT.  Now, the price of any NFT will depend on creativity, uniqueness, scarcity of buyers and owners, and much more.  There are considerable fluctuations in NFT prices because there is no fixed standard for any particular type of NFT.<\/p>\n<p>People cannot determine the factors that can drive the price of NFT.  Due to this, fluctuations in prices remain constant and the evaluation of NFT becomes very challenging.<\/p>\n<h3>legal challenges<\/h3>\n<p>There is no legal definition of NFT known throughout the world.  Different countries like the UK, Japan, and the EU are coming up with different approaches to classifying NFTs.  This makes it necessary to create an international body of non-fungible tokens to establish regulations and legalization throughout the world.<\/p>\n<p>There is a considerable increase in the NFT market, and that is why it is essential to have a regulatory body.  There is a large visible increase in NFT use cases.  Now, this requires a regulatory body that is compliant with NFT rules and regulations.<\/p>\n<p>Current laws related to NFT are still stuck in finding the correct definition for it.  As the market and variety of NFTs are constantly growing, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a solid foundation for NFT compliance.<\/p>\n<h3>Cyber \u200b\u200bThreats and Online Fraud Risks<\/h3>\n<p>The popularity of NFTs has also increased the chances of cyber threats to the NFT market.  Many cases are visible where replicas of the original NFT stores are placed on the Internet.  These stores appear authentic because of the original logo and content.  These fake NFT shops are a huge risk because they can sell NFTs that are not even present in the digital world.  On top of that, there are chances of counterfeit NFTs being sold in a fake NFT shop.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-64662 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/infobloom.site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/1651586989_527_Challenges-and-risks-associated-with-non-fungible-tokens-NFTs.jpg\" alt=\"cyber threats\" width=\"885\" height=\"628\"  \/><\/p>\n<p>Another risk is when someone poses as a famous NFT artist and sells fake NFTs.  The risk of online fraud is huge due to copyright theft, fake airdrops, fake NFT giveaways, and replication of popular NFTs.  Some people even promote these giveaways on social media to gain more traction.  While promoting NFT, some people get scammed at these fake stores.<\/p>\n<h3>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS<\/h3>\n<p>Ownership of any NFT is another important issue to consider.  When you try to buy an NFT on the market, you need to find out if the seller actually owns that NFT or not.  There are scenarios where people pose as sellers while only having replicas.  Here, you will only receive the right to use that NFT, but not the intellectual property rights.<\/p>\n<p>If you review the smart contract metadata, you will find the terms and conditions for ownership of that NFT.  There should be a rule that artists can only display NFTs they own.  It is not possible to relate NFT markets to traditional property laws.  New intellectual property rights such as the right of publicity, trademarks, copyrights, and moral rights must be taken into account for decentralized blockchain technology.<\/p>\n<h3>The challenge of considering NFTs as securities<\/h3>\n<p>Several people consider buying NFTs as securities.  The chairman of the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) stated that most NFTs on the market are sold as securities.  But in reality, the Supreme Court has associated NFTs only with investment contracts.  Now this is a big risk for NFT.  If NFTs want to be eligible as securities, they must pass certain parameters of the Howey test.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb<\/h3>\n<p>Before you jump into something just because of the hype, you need to do some extensive research.  When it comes to non-fungible tokens, it is much better if you understand all the risks and challenges first.  This will even make it easier for you to buy and sell NFTs in the market by removing risks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\">Read about the best cryptocurrency lending platforms below.<br \/>Here is the complete guide to Minting and listing your first NFT.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NFTs are becoming famous and you have surely heard a bit about them.
