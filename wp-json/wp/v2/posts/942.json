Fraud is committed by those who, for profit, use enough deception to produce an error in another, inducing him to carry out an act of disposition to his own or another&#8217;s detriment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">2. They are also considered guilty of fraud:<\/p>\n<p class=\"parrafo_2\">a) Those who, for profit and using some computer manipulation or similar artifice, achieve a non-consensual transfer of any patrimonial asset to the detriment of another.<\/p>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">b) Those who manufacture, introduce, possess or facilitate computer programs specifically intended for the commission of the fraud provided for in this article.<\/p>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">c) Those who, using credit or debit cards, or traveler&#8217;s checks, or the data contained in any of them, carry out operations of any kind to the detriment of their owner or a third party.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"parrafo\" style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><strong>The elements of the crime of fraud<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><strong>1st.<\/strong>\u2013 A preceding or concurrent deception embodied in some artifice.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2nd.-<\/strong> Saying <strong>deception must be enough <\/strong>for the achievement of the proposed purposes, and with sufficient entity to cause the transfer of assets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3rd.-<\/strong> Production of an essential error in the taxpayer (victim), unaware of what constituted reality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4th.-<\/strong> An act of patrimonial displacement, with the consequent damage to the passive subject (victim).<\/p>\n<p><strong>5th.-<\/strong> Causal link between the deception of the author of the fraud and the damage of the victim, with which the fraud (intent to deceive) must precede or be concurrent in the fraud dynamic, not criminally assessing the fraud that occurred, not prior to the celebration of the business in question.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6th.-<\/strong> For-profit, which consist of the intention of obtaining an enrichment of a patrimonial nature.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Supreme Court ruling of 12.26.2014:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The elements that structure the crime of fraud, according to the guidelines established by doctrine and jurisprudence, are the following:<\/p>\n<p><strong>one.-<\/strong> The use of a previous deceit, enough and causing, by the author of the crime, to generate a risk not allowed for the legal good (first trial of objective imputation); this sufficiency, suitability or adequacy of the deception must be established in accordance with a mixed objective-subjective scale, in which both the level of perspicacity or intellection of the average citizen and the specific circumstances that individualize the capacity of the passive subject in the case are weighted concrete.<\/p>\n<p><strong>two.-<\/strong> The deception must trigger the error of the passive subject of the action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.-<\/strong> There must also be an act of patrimonial disposition of the passive subject, precisely due to the error, for the benefit of the perpetrator of the fraud or of a third party, displacement that would not have occurred if the real nature of the operation had been known.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.-<\/strong> Deceptive conduct must be executed with intent and for profit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.-<\/strong> Damage to the victim must derive from it, damage that must appear causally linked to the deceptive action (causal or naturalistic link) and materialize in it the illicit risk that the deceptive action of the active subject supposes for the victim&#8217;s assets. (risk ratio or second judgment of objective imputation).<\/p>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">The fundamental requirement of this criminal offense is deception, which is its most significant, essential and defining element, and which marks its difference with the <strong>misappropriation<\/strong>having the deception to be necessarily:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"parrafo\"><strong>antecedent deception.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li class=\"parrafo\"><strong>causative deception.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li class=\"parrafo\"><strong>quite cheating.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 class=\"parrafo\" style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><strong>Penalty to be imposed for the crime of fraud<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">The basic type of the crime of fraud is punishable by imprisonment from 6 months to 3 years (article 249 Penal Code).<\/p>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">If the amount of the defrauded does not exceed 400 euros, the penalty of a fine of 1 to 3 months (<strong>misdemeanor fraud<\/strong>).<\/p>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">The crime of fraud can be <strong>aggravated<\/strong> if the circumstances of article 250 C. Criminal are met, it can reach a prison sentence of 4 to 8 years and a fine of 12 to 24 months.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"parrafo\" style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><strong>Crime of fraud or civil matter <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">The Supreme Court, when we are faced with a contractual breach, has established the difference between when the conduct of the subject finds accommodation in the criminal precept (fraud) and when it would be a civil matter:<\/p>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">\u201cThe fraud exists only in cases in which the author simulates a serious purpose of contracting when in reality he only wanted to take advantage of the compliance of the opposing party and the breach itself; This purpose is difficult to demonstrate, of course, and which must therefore be obtained normally by way of inference or deduction, starting with such circumstantial evidence, far from mere suspicion, of base facts that are certainly significant according to the rules of logic and of the experience, in order to reach the full proof of the fact-consequence, fully immersed in the crime.<\/p>\n<p class=\"parrafo\">And that deception (continues the TS) has to cause a chain of error, patrimonial displacement, damage and unfair profit; but it must provoke it antecedently, not superveningly. The criminalized business will be the door of the fraud only when it constitutes a pure fiction at the service of fraud from which an empty business is created that really contains a deception or artifice to the patrimony of others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jurisprudence has been developing and establishing for many years the elements of the crime of fraud in order to differentiate when we are faced with a criminal offense (crime of fraud) from a civil matter outside criminal law and therefore not sanctioned by this jurisdiction.
