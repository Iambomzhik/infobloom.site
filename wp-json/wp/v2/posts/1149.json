Confusing the victim is a deliberate act;  the liar is meant to have her misinformed.  The lie may or may not be justified in the opinion of the person telling it or of the community to which it belongs.  The liar can be a good or a bad person, he can count on everyone&#8217;s sympathy or be unfriendly and unpleasant to everyone.  But the important thing is that the person who lies is in a position to choose between lying and telling the truth, and knows the difference.<\/p>\n<p>Quotes of &#8220;<strong>How to detect lies<\/strong>(1985) &#8211; Paul Ekman<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">26.As is known, deception works for two things.  First, the deceiver is very subtle and convincing in his plans, that is, he looks\/feels\/acts as if he were the real deal.  Second, and equally important, the deceived subject must be predisposed to believe that the deceiver is indeed authentic.  These two criteria work inversely with each other: a sufficiently deceitful guy can convince a skeptical victim, while a victim who desperately wants to believe will be able to overlook serious flaws in the person he trusts.<\/p>\n<p>Quotes of &#8220;<strong>android dream<\/strong>(2006) &#8211; John Scalzi<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">27.

It was all deceitful, like those stories that children are told to make their eyes shine.<\/p>\n<p>Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">28.(&#8230;) One-armed and sick lies, violent and wicked, lies with legs and wheels, lies with a jacket and lies with a mustache.  Some lies that he invented instantly, without thinking that one day he would have to meet them again.<\/p>\n<p>Etgar Keret<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">29. As far as women are concerned, it is about reciprocal deceptions that do not enter into the account, because when love gets in the way, it is common for one to deceive the other.<\/p>\n<p>Giacomo Casanova<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">30.When witnesses make up lies, they tend to forget the most obvious issues.  And the same goes for their lawyers.  They become so obsessed with deception that some detail is always overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>John Grisham<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">31. The simple suggestion of fame and fortune fills everything with glamour.  It is quite alarming how quickly people turn someone&#8217;s deception into fact in order to fuel their own deceptions.<\/p>\n<p>Libba Bray<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">32.Something more, something less, my dear boy, the voices of men are all a delusion;  we are only honest when we are children, and then in the grave.<\/p>\n<p>Hermann Hesse<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">33.

But it was all a hoax.  That laugh didn&#8217;t last long.<\/p>\n<p>Henri Michael<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">35. Although the analogy is often misleading, it is the least misleading thing we have.<\/p>\n<p>Samuel Butler<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">36.In times of universal deception, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act.<\/p>\n<p>George Orwell<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">37. There are things that even if they are said, they are not meant to be understood.<\/p>\n<p>Pedro Calderon De La Barca<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">38. The one who can best cover them can better use their appetites.<\/p>\n<p>Seneca<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">39. Art is the most beautiful of all deceptions.<\/p>\n<p>Claude Debussy<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">40. There is deception when what is first denied is granted.<\/p>\n<p>Seneca<\/p>\n<p class=\"frase\">41.
