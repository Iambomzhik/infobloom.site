Such is the case of Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, who sold his first tweet for $2.9 million.<\/p>\n<p>Although NFTs are unique digital pieces, there are also NFTs that are not unique, such as digital collection cards and cards where the rarity and exclusivity of the piece is valued, with a smaller number for those that are considered rarer;  which makes its economic value increase over time.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Where can they be purchased?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>NFTs can be acquired through platforms such as Niftygateway, MakersPlace or Valuable where creators, artists and owners of NFTs put their digital property up for sale.  Sales can be made at a fixed price or through auctions, whose means of payment are cryptocurrencies such as Ether and where a cryptocurrency wallet is required to carry out the transaction.<\/p>\n<p>Today, NFTs are considered a revolutionary digital property medium due to their usefulness in providing ownership certificates to non-tangible digital creations, giving artists and digital content creators the ability to legitimately sell their work.  In addition, it allows the verification of the authenticity of the works represented by the tokens, especially in the future considering the ever closer Metaverse.<\/p>\n<p>Also, NTFs look promising due to the discussion about their use beyond collecting, art and market price gouging.  This technology could be used to certify physical products and even help with identity management from anywhere on the planet through identity documents or digital passports.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is also a growing concern about the environmental impact of their generation and transaction due to the amount of energy resources required.  Likewise, there have already been reported cases of fraud related to NFTs with sales of fake works where they seek to appropriate the cryptocurrencies of the victims.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, given the increasingly continuous and visible announcements about the arrival of the Metaverse, NFTs represent a way of being able to market authentic digital content, beyond the servers and storage of a single company, but throughout the entire world and in any where we meet.
