It is a common practice on bitcoin exchanges trying to increase trading volume.<\/p>\n<p>According to experts, selling a token to a wallet that already owns it is a relatively simple operation in this small universe where no one is forced to reveal their identity.<\/p>\n<p>In 2021, the corporation found that even though the vast majority of people who tried wash trading failed, those who did succeed made a fortune.<\/p>\n<p>Only 41% of the 262 wash trading activities were profitable, despite generating more than \u20ac7.8 million in revenue.  The remainder suffered a loss of approximately 500,000.<\/p>\n<p>According to the research findings, NFT (fake volume) wash trading is illegal.  \u201cHowever, although wash trading is prohibited in traditional markets, it has not yet been investigated in non-traditional markets\u2026.

During the second and third quarters of 2021, the vast majority of this activity came from addresses associated with fraud.<\/p>\n<p>In one case in the fourth quarter, some 250,000 euros in bitcoins were transferred from Chatex, a virtual cryptocurrency exchange where suspects of money laundering, terrorism and drug trafficking are found.<\/p>\n<p><source data-lazy-  type=\"image\/webp\"><\/source><\/p>\n<p>Aside from these two approaches, crooks use a variety of different techniques.
