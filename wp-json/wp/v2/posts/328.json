However, many people apparently fell for the hoax, with 91 Stolen NFTs from connected wallets with a combined value of over $2.8 million, based on the current minimum price (or cheapest available NFT) of each collection.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet mx-auto\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udea8There is no mint going on today.  It looks like BAYC Instagram was hacked.  Do not mint anything, click links, or link your wallet to anything.<\/p>\n<p>\u2013 Bored Ape Yacht Club (@BoredApeYC) April 25, 2022<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">According to blockchain detective zachxbt, the wallet linked to the scam managed to steal four NFTs from the Bored Ape Yacht Club, seven NFTs from the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and three NFTs from the Bored Ape Kennel Club, as well as a number of other NFTs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Other reports have claimed that the official Bored Ape Yacht Club Discord server was also hacked today, but this does not appear to be the case.  However, Bored Ape&#8217;s Discord was previously hacked on April 1.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">&#8220;This morning our team was alerted that the official Bored Ape Yacht Club Instagram account was hacked,&#8221; read an official statement from Yuga Labs, provided to Decrypt.  &#8220;The hacker posted a fraudulent link to a fake Bored Ape Yacht Club website, where a safeTransferFrom attack asked users to connect their MetaMask to the scammer&#8217;s wallet to participate in a fake airdrop.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">&#8220;At 9:53 a.m. ET, we alerted our community, removed all links to Instagram from our platforms, and attempted to recover the hacked Instagram account,&#8221; the statement continues.  &#8220;Two-factor authentication was enabled and the security practices surrounding the IG account were strict. Yuga Labs and Instagram are currently investigating how the hacker was able to access the account. We are still investigating.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Yuga Labs estimated the total value of the stolen NFTs to be around $3 million, which matches data extracted from the attacker&#8217;s wallet.  The firm also said it is &#8220;actively working to establish contact with affected users,&#8221; but did not share any details about possible plans to reimburse affected Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT holders.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">The Instagram scam follows a wave of Twitter scams in which the verified accounts of many users have been hijacked and used to carry out similar NFT theft attacks.  That particular scam originated with ApeCoin, the recently launched Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem token, and has since spread to Azuki and Moonbirds.  To be clear, the creators of those projects are not involved in the scams.<\/p>\n<p class=\"font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg sm:text-xl sm:leading-9 tracking-px text-body\">Some of the affected Twitter users have told <i>Decrypt<\/i> that their accounts also had two-factor authentication enabled.  A Twitter representative told <i>Decrypt<\/i> on April 8 that it was &#8220;aware of and actively working on a solution to combat&#8221; such scams, but did not provide an update when asked last week.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"font-ak-bold text-lg leading-none text-neutral-800\">The best of Decrypt straight to your inbox.<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Get the top stories curated daily, weekly roundups &#038; deep dives straight to your inbox.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The official Instagram account of the Bored Ape Yacht Club was hacked on Monday, sharing a link to a scam website that has apparently stolen over $2.8 million in NFT from people who connected their Walletwallets.[\/definici\u00f3n] of Ethereum.
