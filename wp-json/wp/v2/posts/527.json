Let&#8217;s explain this with an example.  If two people exchange a \u20ac50 bill, they both have exactly the same value.  It is a consumable tool.  Otherwise, the other is irreplaceable, and if I don&#8217;t talk to someone, I won&#8217;t find exactly the same thing.  Cryptocurrencies are considered convertible because if two people own bitcoins and exchange them, they are exactly the same.  Things that do not happen with NFTS.  NFTS: what they are and why they have gone viral.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain itself is a technology that records all transactions and allows you to keep track of who owns the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>What are the characteristics of NFTS?  As we mentioned, unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be exchanged with each other because no two NFTs are the same.  In addition, NFTS has other features:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Unusual and unique: These properties have much in common with works of art.  There may be copies of it, but only the owner can verify that he is the true and sole owner of the original work.<br \/>\u2022 Indivisible: Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be divided into smaller, full-value parts, such as a total or tokens.<br \/>\u2022 Indestructible \u2013 NFT data is stored on the blockchain via smart contracts, which means it cannot be destroyed, deleted or copied.  \u2022 Full Ownership \u2013 Unlike music or movies, if you buy one of these items, full ownership is yours.  You don&#8217;t need to buy a license to watch movies or listen to songs.  But this invisible thing is all yours.<br \/>\u2022 Verifiable: Blockchains can verify more complex things, such as graph-related issues or phishing.<\/p>\n<p>How to make money with NFTS?  As the only irreplaceable and non-removable file, NFTS cannot be copied at all.<br \/>It&#8217;s like having a Mona Lisa painting, everyone can have a Mona Lisa painting at home.  Today there are digital tools that create an exact copy of an image.  But we all know that the original Mona Lisa was the original intention of the NFT.<br \/>The so-called Cryptoart is the source of this token, and some artists have started selling or auctioning off their assets for photography or digital art to get funding.  So, for example, an animated gift for sale on The Foundation, a website that buys and sells digital goods through cryptocurrencies, is worth nearly $600,000.<\/p>\n<p>The rise of NFTS<br \/>Such is the influence of the NFTS, actress Lindsay Lohan, who sold a photo of her face for over $17,000, tweeted: \u201cBitcoin holds a promising future.<br \/>According to CoinMarketCap (www.coinmarketcap.com), the NFTS market has increased tenfold since last February.  According to experts, this could even overshadow Bitcoin&#8217;s super-fast price rise in recent months.  Various apps and websites have started offering NFT-backed loans.  For its part, Theta Token is a platform that allows users to watch digital content such as eSports using the blockchain, and there are plans to allow entertainment companies to issue NFTS as excerpts from shows and your favorite movies or as part of upcoming blockbusters. .<br \/>Another example is Chiliz, a cryptocurrency that currently has a value of $0.50 and can be used to issue tickets for sports clubs like FC Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhose value tripled 23 times in the last year.  It recently announced plans to launch NFTS in partnership with professional sports teams so users can use cryptocurrency to purchase items.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, if you are interested in different areas related to IT and communications, in the Installer Course we have certificates that help you train as a professional.
