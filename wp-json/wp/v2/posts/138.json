Expendable goods have a certain value, but can be exchanged.  For example, a note can be exchanged for another with the same value and the owner still owns a certain amount.<\/p>\n<p>Non-expendable assets are those that have value, but are irreplaceable.  A work of art, a historical relic, or a signed trading card are examples of non-expendable property, as they cannot be exchanged for the same.<\/p>\n<p>Non-expendable property may have a monetary value, but there is no other item like it in the world and its authenticity can be verified by experts.  These goods are usually sold with a certificate of authenticity and that is why they are so valuable.<\/p>\n<p>NFT stands for Non Fungible Token or non-fungible voucher;  that is, irreplaceable.  However, an NFT is not a physical asset.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs have a close relationship with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.  Cryptocurrencies and NFTs belong to the blockchain system, a digital business model that securely records digital transactions.<\/p>\n<p>An NFT is also known as a crypto art since the transactions work in a similar way to cryptocurrencies;  however, in the digital world, a cryptocurrency is the equivalent of a bill (fungible good) and an NFT is equivalent to a work of art (non-fungible good).<\/p>\n<p>This means that an NFT is a unique and irreplaceable item that does not have a replica;  however, the owner does not own it in a tangible way, but obtains a digital ownership certificate.  This certificate is validated by the blockchain system with metadata that cannot be duplicated, as it guarantees its authenticity, value and transaction history.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, just like a piece of art, the owner of an NFT can sell their digital asset at any time to another person and its value could increase over the years.<\/p>\n<p><h3 class=\"cms-H3-H3\">Examples and price of an NFT<\/h3>\n<\/p>\n<p>More and more people are joining the trend of selling or acquiring NFTs, but, just like art exhibitions or collectibles, there are elements that are more famous and valuable than others.<\/p>\n<p>In March 2021, Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, sold his first NFT-certified tweet for $2.9 million.  Anyone can take a screenshot of the tweet and even print it out;  however, there is only one digital certificate for the tweet that verifies it as NFT.<\/p>\n<p><iframe height=\"0\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;just setting up my twttr&lt;\/p&gt;&amp;mdash; jack\u26a1\ufe0f (@jack) &lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/twitter.com\/jack\/status\/20?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 21, 2006&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;&#10;&lt;script async src=&quot;https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;&#10;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"socialEmbed-twitter\" class=\"sc-1samzfd-1 eqhtlM\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Singer <b>Grimes<\/b> collaborated with a crypto art site to sell $6 million worth of musical and graphic works.
