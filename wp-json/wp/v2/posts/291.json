Little by little they are conquering new spaces in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you still have doubts, then we will explain it very briefly.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is there a difference between NFT and cryptocurrencies?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This is a very recurring question, especially since in both cases we are talking about tokens, another concept that is still not entirely clear.<\/p>\n<p>But the truth is yes.  Yes, there really is a difference between NFT and cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<p>To understand it better, it is necessary to define each concept separately, starting with the token, since it is a category that is sometimes applied to both NFTs and cryptocurrencies.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is a token?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Outside the crypto world, a token is anything to which a certain value can be added and which serves as an object of exchange.  They are not official and are issued by private entities for their members to use within their ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>They are like chips in casinos, or money in some zoos and amusement parks.  However, among the users themselves these tokens can have great value.<\/p>\n<p>Now, because blockchain technology offers security, traceability, transparency, speed, and decentralization, tokens have started to be created more and more.<\/p>\n<p>And this is because, on the web, tokens are digital assets that work within blockchains, regardless of whether they are their \u201cofficial currency\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>If we go back to the example of the casino or the zoos and amusement parks, the tokens would be like \u201cunofficial\u201d money or chips, but they can be used in the same way.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are cryptocurrencies?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It is very common that cryptocurrencies are also known as tokens.  This is because all cryptocurrencies are tokens created on blockchain technology.<\/p>\n<p>However, cryptocurrency is specifically called digital assets that have their own blockchain, for example Bitcoin, Ethereum or BNB.  Cryptocurrencies are indeed that &#8220;official currency&#8221; within a blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>However, just like any other token, they are used as payment methods in the virtual world.<\/p>\n<p>The first cryptocurrency created is Bitcoin, which works on the blockchain of the same name.  The second is Ether, which runs on the blockchain called Ethereum.  The latter hosts many tokens.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are NFTs?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>NFTs are tokens that have a specific characteristic: they are not fungible (interchangeable).  Its name comes from the English Non-Fungible Token.<\/p>\n<p>Any digital file (videos, photos, books, GIFs, etc.) can be converted into an NFT.  By becoming NFTs, these digital assets acquire an essential characteristic: they are unique.<\/p>\n<p>This type of token is sold in specific NFT markets, although more and more large auction houses such as Christie&#8217;s and Sotheby&#8217;s have entered the auction of digital art pieces in NFT format.  Therefore, they are bought to collect or as a form of investment.<\/p>\n<p>NFTs are highly valued for their multiplicity of uses.  They are present in art, music, books, movies and much more.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2><strong>So the difference between NFTs and cryptocurrencies is\u2026 <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As we explained to you before, cryptocurrencies are digital assets or tokens native to their own blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>They are used as digital money, so they can be exchanged (a bitcoin is worth the same as another bitcoin) and divided.<\/p>\n<p>While NFTs are tokens that are not equivalent to other NFTs as they have their uniqueness feature.  None is the same as another and they are unrepeatable.<\/p>\n<p>Their similarity is that they are digital assets that work on the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>At Woonkly you can easily create and monetize them.<\/p>\n<p>Do you want to learn how to create an NFT?
